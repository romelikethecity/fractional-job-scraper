**WHO WE ARE**

TechnologyMatch is a buyer\-first B2B technology matchmaking platform transforming how enterprise IT leaders discover and evaluate technology partners.

We combine proprietary buyer intent data, intelligent automation, and human\-led qualification to connect vetted enterprise technology vendors with verified demand. Unlike traditional demand generation models, we focus on alignment, intent, and fit — delivering high\-trust introductions that accelerate real purchasing decisions.

Today, the majority of our revenue is driven by high\-touch services. We are actively transitioning toward a unified AI\-integrated platform where automation, SaaS subscriptions, and agentic systems drive scalable recurring revenue.

We are profitable, with established enterprise relationships and meaningful recurring revenue, and are now focused on materially increasing platform\-driven ARR as a percentage of total revenue.

**CORE VALUES:**

* We tell the truth with heart: We speak honestly and directly, We don’t avoid hard conversations, We give feedback with care and respect \& We assume positive intent
* We are always evolving: We seek to learn and improve, We adapt when something isn’t working, We don’t cling to outdated ways \& We take initiative to get better
* We own outcomes: We take responsibility for results, We don’t wait to be told, We don’t blame constraints \& We fight for the outcome
* We execute with excellence: We do high\-quality work, We finish what we start, We pay attention to details \& We take pride in our craft

**If our mission and values don't resonate with you, please don't apply.**

**JOB DESCRIPTION**

The Technology Match team is looking for a seasoned, commercially sharp COO/Strategic Operator with a proven track record in SaaS environments and business transformation. This is not a role for someone learning the ropes, we need someone who has navigated a business through a major evolution before and can do it again.

You'll step into a pivotal moment: we are actively transitioning from a high\-touch services model to a scalable SaaS and AI\-powered platform. The CEO is driving strategic vision and platform direction. This role ensures disciplined execution across the organization.

The application code word is EMPOWER. This role requires a highly skilled strategic thinker who anticipates and solves problems in a self\-directed way, and who empowers the team to move fast while maintaining quality and culture.

This is a full\-time, remote position, and open to a W2 or 1099 agreement. Given the critical nature of this role, we host a rigorous, 4\-part application process.

**WHAT MAKES THIS ROLE UNIQUE**

You are stepping into a profitable company at a strategic inflection point.

TechnologyMatch has strong market traction, established enterprise relationships, recurring revenue, and proprietary technology in development. The strategic direction is clear. The CEO is driving platform vision, AI strategy, and long\-term capital positioning. What’s needed now is disciplined operational leadership to execute the transformation with rigor and measurable progress.

This is not a maintenance role. It is a structural evolution of the revenue engine.

**THE TRANSFORMATION MANDATE**

The business currently generates the majority of its revenue through high\-touch services. The strategic objective is to transition toward a unified AI\-integrated platform where automation, SaaS subscriptions, and agentic systems become the primary drivers of scalable recurring revenue and margin expansion.

Your mandate is to operationalize that shift.

This includes:

* Increasing platform\-driven revenue mix as a percentage of total ARR while expanding gross margin
* Productizing repeatable service workflows into scalable platform functionality
* Reducing manual execution through AI\-augmented and agentic automation
* Consolidating fragmented systems into a unified operating and reporting infrastructure
* Defining and executing a quarterly revenue mix shift plan tied to ARR and margin targets
* Aligning all operational decisions with an exit\-oriented, high\-multiple software trajectory

This is not a cosmetic SaaS overlay. It is a structural revenue model transformation.

Your success will be measured by tangible shifts in revenue composition, operational efficiency, margin profile, and founder independence from day\-to\-day execution.

**RESPONSIBILITIES**

**Strategic Execution \& Business Transformation**

* Serve as the primary Integrator, assuming full operational ownership so the CEO can focus exclusively on strategy, capital, and growth.
* Lead organizational design and restructuring decisions required to support a platform\-led operating model
* Own operational P\&L accountability in partnership with the CEO and CFO
* Drive the deliberate reduction of services dependency by converting repeatable service workflows into scalable, AI\-powered platform functionality that increases recurring revenue and margin.
* Ensure all business functions and decisions are aligned with the exit strategy and SaaS growth trajectory
* Hold the leadership team accountable to strategic priorities and quarterly OKRs/Rocks
* Establish guardrails for founder input to maintain strategic focus and operational consistency
* Define and execute a clear revenue mix shift plan with quarterly targets for platform\-driven ARR
* Establish a quarterly scorecard that tracks revenue mix, margin expansion, platform adoption, and operational efficiency

**Product \& Technology Ownership**

* Partner with the CTO to prioritize platform features that directly increase recurring revenue and margin expansion
* Define how AI and automation can be deployed to scale previously manual workflows
* Ensure all roads lead back to platform adoption and SaaS growth metrics (ARR, retention, NRR)

**Operational \& Process Management**

* Build efficient, documented processes and procedures across all operational functions
* Establish a clear operating system for the business
* Redesign and optimize systems to remove bottlenecks and squeeze margin from existing infrastructure
* Oversee and develop the existing Operations Manager as your 2IC

**Finance \& Data Integrity**

* Partner with the fractional CFO to ensure financial reporting is accurate, timely, and used for strategic decisions
* Rectify data integrity issues and establish a single source of truth across all reporting
* Manage financial planning and analysis to support the growth and exit timeline
* Track and report on SaaS\-specific metrics including revenue mix, gross margin, CAC efficiency, retention, and NRR
* Build dashboards and reporting infrastructure that give leadership real\-time operational visibility

**About Anomaly Health**
------------------------


Anomaly is a virtual concierge longevity clinic making proactive, physician\-guided health optimization accessible at scale. We go beyond the annual checkup — delivering continuous monitoring, comprehensive lab coordination, and time\-boxed optimization programs tailored to each member's health goals.


We move fast, we sweat details, and we treat clinical quality as the product. This is the first clinical hire. You won't just be a medical advisor — you'll be the clinical brain of the company.

**The Role**
------------


As Founding Longevity MD, you will set the clinical standard for everything we do — from protocol development and lab interpretation to patient safety, regulatory posture, and physician oversight of AI\-driven outputs. You'll work directly with the CEO and product team to translate cutting\-edge longevity science into scalable, defensible clinical workflows.


This role is for a physician who thinks like a builder. Excited about what AI can do for medicine, deeply skeptical of hype, and relentless about getting the evidence right.

**Who You'll Be Working With**
------------------------------

  

Ramin Sahebjavaher, PhD is the founder and CEO of Anomaly Health. He was an early member of Prenuvo's product and AI team, helping build the company from its early days into one of the most recognized names in preventive imaging. He later worked closely with elite concierge longevity clinics and led an executive health program focused on dementia prevention.


Anomaly has a core team across engineering, product, GTM, and strategy. This role partners directly with the founder and team to build the clinical foundation of the company.

**What You'll Do**
------------------

* Co\-develop and own our clinical protocol framework — biomarker panels, care pathways, and optimization areas (you'll shape this from the ground up)
* Conduct member\-facing clinical sessions — consultations, results reviews, and ongoing optimization check\-ins
* Review and sign off on AI\-generated health reports, maintaining final clinical accountability for all member\-facing content
* Build and enforce clinical safety, consent, and escalation frameworks
* Serve as medical reviewer for edge cases, abnormal findings, and high\-risk members
* Hire and manage contracted physicians and NPs as the clinical team scales
* Represent Anomaly externally and contribute to product strategy at the intersection of clinical evidence and member experience

**What We're Looking For**
--------------------------

* MD with board certification in Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, or related specialty — fellowship in Functional, Preventive, or Longevity Medicine strongly preferred
* Deep fluency in longevity biomarkers: advanced lipids, metabolomics, hormonal panels, inflammatory markers, CGM, and genomics
* Prior experience in a startup, digital health company, or concierge/direct\-care practice
* Comfort with AI\-assisted clinical tools and a clear\-eyed view of their limitations
* Entrepreneurial mindset — you see gaps and build systems to fill them

**Nice to Have**
----------------

* IFM, ABAARM, or equivalent longevity/functional medicine certification
* Medical licensure in New York and/or surrounding states (NJ, CT)
* Prior experience structuring telemedicine consent or async care models
* Network within the longevity medicine or preventive care communities

**What We Offer:**
------------------

* Founding equity and a front row seat to building a world\-class startup founder and team
* Flexible engagement structured around your existing commitments that can scale as we build conviction in doing this together
* Fully remote/virtual
* Ownership in shaping a great experience and product

  

Anomaly Health recruits, employs, trains, compensates, and promotes regardless of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, disability, age, veteran status, and other protected statuses as required by applicable law.

We are structured as an acquisition holding company and acquire controlling stakes in traditional business services companies to transform them with custom built AI solutions and operate them as subsidiaries.

  

We are based in Silicon Valley, Toronto, and Berlin and have raised significant funding to achieve our mission. Our founding team boasts a remarkable track record in the startup ecosystem, with each member having previously steered AI startups to unicorn status. As we write this new chapter in AI, we invite you to be part of this exciting journey and exceptional team that’s not just watching the future unfold but actively molding it.

  

We are looking for a Controller to be the financial backbone of our growing, multi\-entity organization. This is a high\-impact, hands\-on role for someone who thrives in an innovative and agile environment, not a role for someone who manages from a distance. You will own the books, build the infrastructure, and be a trusted strategic partner to leadership given our acquisition\-heavy strategy.

 **What's in it for you?**

* Ownership of the full accounting function at a high\-growth AI company from the ground up.
* A seat at the table with leadership—your work directly shapes company decisions.

* Prepare and present accurate, GAAP\-compliant financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow) to leadership and external stakeholders.
* Manage external fractional book keeping and accounting resources, who will report directly to you.
* Develop, implement, and enforce internal controls and accounting policies to ensure compliance and safeguard company assets.
* Partner with the Finance Lead, external resources, and the executive team to provide financial insights that inform strategic decision\-making.
* Own revenue recognition processes, ensuring compliance with ASC 606\.
* Oversee accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll accounting, and treasury functions.
* Build and improve scalable accounting processes and workflows appropriate for a fast\-growing startup, balancing rigor with speed.
* Build out the accounting technology stack and team.
* Once our investors impose audit requirements, manage and coordinate the annual audit process, serving as the primary point of contact for external auditors.

* CPA required. Bachelor’s degree in Accounting or Finance; Master’s preferred.
* 8\+ years of progressive accounting experience, including a minimum of 3 years in a Controller, Assistant Controller, or equivalent role.
* Prior experience in public accounting (Big 4 or national firm) strongly preferred.
* Deep, hands\-on experience with general ledger systems (e.g., NetSuite or comparable ERP platforms) \- not just oversight, but building and configuring.
* Demonstrated experience consolidating financial statements across multiple legal entities.
* Strong command of US GAAP, including ASC 606 (revenue recognition), lease accounting (ASC 842\), and stock\-based compensation (ASC 718\).
* Experience managing the full audit cycle with external auditors.
* Exceptional attention to detail paired with the ability to prioritize and move quickly in an ambiguous, fast\-paced environment.

**Nice to haves**

* Experience running accounting for and consolidating international entities, including managing foreign currency translation and multi\-jurisdictional compliance.
* Hands\-on experience implementing or migrating to a new GL / ERP system (e.g., leading a NetSuite or similar system implementation from selection through go\-live).

This role is for someone looking to get in early at a high growth AI startup and heavily shape the future of our finance and accounting team, processes, and policies. You are the type of person who:

* Gets energy from building. You’d rather stand up a process from scratch than inherit a playbook.
* Is comfortable wearing multiple hats and operating across the full scope of accounting.
* Moves fast without sacrificing accuracy. You know how to distinguish between what needs to be perfect and what needs to be done.
* Communicates directly and concisely with cross\-functional partners.
* Has strong opinions, loosely held. You bring expertise but adapt when the situation calls for it.

We are looking to engage a senior Commercial Real Estate professional to act as a fractional client advisor and industry representative for our company in the market.

Zacharin Consulting is hiring an Account Executive to close fractional CFO and outsourced accounting engagements with founders of SaaS companies, healthcare practices, law firms, and professional services businesses. Average deal size is $2K\+/month recurring — you’re not closing a one\-time transaction, you’re starting a long\-term financial partnership.

This is a consultative closing role built on quality, not volume. You’ll run 5 scheduled calls per day with warm inbound leads who’ve already expressed interest. Your job is deep discovery — understanding their financial pain, operational bottlenecks, and growth goals — then positioning Zacharin as the strategic partner who solves it all.

**FAIR WARNING**

This is not a fast\-close, high\-volume sales role. You’ll be speaking with successful business owners about their most critical asset: their finances. They’re smart, skeptical, and they’ve been disappointed by accountants before. Some conversations will take multiple touchpoints over weeks before they commit.

If you’re uncomfortable having deep, strategic conversations about cash flow, profitability, and long\-term growth — or if you need a simple one\-call\-close environment — this isn’t your role. But if you build trust through substance and close through clarity — keep reading.

**COMPENSATION**

* Ramp\-Up Pay: $4,000 for your first 30 days
* Base Salary: $3,000/month (starting after 30\-day ramp)
* New Client Commission: 10% of first month’s revenue per new client
* Residual Commission: 4% recurring on client revenue for months 2–12
* OTE: $120,000–$180,000\+

The residual model is key: every client you close keeps paying you for 11 months. Your income compounds as your client base grows.

**BENEFITS**

* 401(k) with employer match
* Health, dental, vision, and life insurance
* Paid time off
* Professional development and mentorship
* Ongoing coaching and call reviews
* Fully remote with flexible schedule

**WHAT YOU’LL DO**

* Conduct up to 5 consultative calls daily with warm inbound leads — founders and business owners actively seeking financial support
* Run deep discovery: understand their P\&L reality, cash flow challenges, and growth ambitions
* Present Zacharin’s fractional CFO and outsourced accounting services as a clear, tailored solution
* Build trust through expertise and transparency — handle sophisticated objections by addressing them directly
* Manage a pipeline of high\-value prospects with strategic follow\-up over multi\-week cycles
* Track all activity in HubSpot CRM with accurate notes and pipeline staging
* Collaborate with the team on process optimization and client feedback

**YOUR FIRST 90 DAYS**

* Week 1–2: Deep immersion in Zacharin’s service offerings, pricing, client avatar (SaaS, healthcare, law firms, agencies). Shadow top performer calls. Learn the discovery framework.
* Week 3–4: Live calls with coaching — 3\+ calls/day, focusing on discovery depth and objection handling
* Month 2: Independent call block — 5 calls/day, building your pipeline, first closed clients contributing to residual base
* Month 3: Full production — consistent close rate, growing residual income stream, pipeline self\-managed

**WHO YOU ARE**

* 2\+ years of high\-ticket B2B sales experience selling services (not just products), ideally $2K\+/month engagements
* Consultative seller — you’re excellent at deep discovery, building rapport, and earning trust with sophisticated buyers who’ve been burned before
* Comfortable discussing financial topics (P\&L, cash flow, budgeting) at a business owner level — you don’t need to be a CPA, but you need to speak the language
* Experience selling to professional services firms, SaaS companies, or healthcare practices is a strong plus
* Patient and strategic with longer sales cycles — you follow up with purpose, not panic
* CRM disciplined — HubSpot experience preferred

**NOT A FIT IF:**

* You’re a high\-volume, transactional closer looking for quick one\-call wins
* You’re uncomfortable discussing financial topics in depth with business owners
* You can’t manage a multi\-week pipeline without losing track of prospects
* You need constant inbound leads handed to you with no pipeline management

**SUCCESS IN THIS ROLE**

* Consistent close rate on qualified consultations
* Residual income growing month\-over\-month as your client base compounds
* Clients feel they found a financial partner, not that they were sold a service

**HOW TO APPLY**

Apply here: https://tkauh.share.hsforms.com/2vtYTvaAoTVOrsrx\-hi8MAA

The application takes about 5 minutes. After submitting, you’ll complete a short behavioral assessment (3–5 minutes). It helps us understand how you work and sell — there are no right or wrong answers.

Lead. Transform.**


This isn’t consulting. It’s stewardship — of relationships, wealth, and purpose — and it’s about building something bigger than yourself.


As a Captain, you’ll launch a high\-impact fractional family office practice — with a strong CFO\-level execution focus — getting to 12–15 entrepreneurial families quickly, then scaling to lead a mini\-business inside Ark. You’ll support associates, mentor Captains, and help build a client base of 40\+ families — driving transformational outcomes for entrepreneurs around the world. This role is ideal for someone with a CFO background, ready to step into Captain\-level, CFO\-heavy assignments by Day 91\.


This is entrepreneurs serving entrepreneurs — with no ceiling on your impact or your earnings.


If you’re ready to work alongside Ark’s executive\-driven team, lead from the front, and build something that lasts, you’re in the right place.

**About Ark Financial**


At Ark, we believe every entrepreneurial family deserves more than transactions — they deserve transformation. That’s why we built the Family Office Operating System (FOOS), and why we place Captains — not just as planners, but as leaders — at the center of it.

**Your Scoreboard (What You’re Responsible For):**

* Build a portfolio to 12–15 high\-complexity entrepreneurial family relationships.
* Deliver technical execution across estate and succession planning, income and estate tax strategies, risk management analysis, investment coordination, and long\-term net worth growth.
* Lead monthly Family Office Rhythm meetings (focused on cash flow, net worth updates, initiative tracking, and goal alignment).
* Coordinate and align all external advisors (tax, legal, insurance, investment) toward unified family outcomes.
* Drive FOOS implementation with clarity, speed, and spiritual integrity.
* Scale into leadership: mentor associate Captains and help build a team managing 40\+ families.
* Bring CFO\-level leadership to complex client cash flow, entity strategy, and financial decision\-making by your first 90 days.

**What Makes This Role Different**


This is the most intimate and mission\-critical role Ark offers. Captains walk with families through their most vulnerable decisions — wealth transfer, conflict, legacy, and identity. You will not be a task manager. You will be their guide.


Captains lead with truth and love. They hold space when a family feels unclear and speak boldly when clarity is needed. They coordinate deeply technical planning — but they never forget the real mission: to align every financial decision with the family’s vision and purpose.


You won’t do this alone. You’ll collaborate with Ark Strategists, fellow Captains, and our trusted advisor network — all working toward helping families live with ever greater Protection, Peace, and Purpose.

**What It Feels Like to Work With You**

* You bring peace into the room.
* You listen deeply, speak with intentionality, and lead without ego.
* Your presence is calm, grounded, and quietly authoritative.
* You’re technically sharp — fluent in complex planning topics (estate, tax, risk, investment) and able to translate them with clarity and humility.

**What Makes You a Fit**

* You’ve led financial strategy for others — as an advisor, executive, or business owner.
* You’ve carried real financial weight and made high\-stakes decisions.
* You’ve managed multiple clients or teams and thrived under complexity.
* You’re fluent in estate structures (wills, trusts, charitable strategies), income and estate tax optimization, risk management frameworks, investment strategy basics, and overall family governance planning.
* You’ve done the inner work: emotional intelligence, humility, maturity.
* Experience in — or a strong desire to serve — musicians, influencers, professional athletes, and other high\-visibility entrepreneurial families.

**Why This Role Is Hard**

* You must blend technical mastery, relational presence, and entrepreneurial rigor.
* You’ll build and steward 12–15 families at first — which demands systems, prioritization, and stamina.
* You’ll scale to lead a 40\+ family ""book"" and support the development of other Captains and associates.
* You must lead entrepreneurial clients as peers — with strength, care, and stewardship.

**The FOOS Life — For You Too**


Our best Captains don’t just deliver FOOS. They live it.


Their own cash flow is clear. Their legal and financial affairs are in order. Their family vision is alive and reviewed monthly. They embody the same intentionality they call others to.

**Details**

* Location: Remote (Nashville, TN preferred). Ark Financial is based in Austin, TX.
* Role Type: 1099 contractor (not W\-2\)
* Compensation: Uncapped revenue share model
* Draw Option: $100K/year recoverable draw available
* No\-Draw Option: Higher revenue share (\~$60K\+ additional upside in the first two years)
* On\-Target Earnings (OTE):
* Year 1: $100K–$130K (build and ramp phase)
* Year 2: $180K–$235K (established portfolio)
* Year 3\+: $330K\+ (fully optimized 12–15 family book)
* Long\-Term Growth:
* Captains who scale a 40\+ family mini\-business can exceed $700K\+ annually on the high\-growth track (typically by Year 5\+).
* Start Date: ASAP

**What to Do Next**


This role is for learners. Builders. Leaders who want to stretch and grow while helping families do the same.


You’ll see marriages strengthened. Wealth aligned with purpose. Legacy that’s more than just assets — it’s stewardship in action.


If you’ve built something that matters, and want to help families do the same — send your resume and a short note on why this role is calling your name.


We move fast. Let’s talk.

The healthcare payment system is a complex and inefficient maze \- healthcare practices leave $125 billion in revenue uncollected each year, lost in the chaos of fragmented financial data, manual workflows, and opaque payer systems. This financial uncertainty leaves practices struggling to stay afloat, while valuable revenue slips through the cracks.


Joyful Health is building the AI\-powered financial operating system for healthcare practices. Our mission is to bring the joy back to running a private practice by simplifying financial operations so providers can focus on patient care. We spent 10 months working as fractional CFOs for a dozen practices, doing this work side by side with providers as we developed our product.


We just closed a funding round led by world\-class investors and angels including the founders of MongoDB \& KAYAK.


We have an enormous opportunity in front of us. The broken healthcare payment ecosystem impacts practices of all sizes, and the opportunity to make a real difference is massive.

**Role Description**
--------------------


Joyful Health is a small, fast\-moving startup, and we’re looking for an Executive Assistant to join our team in our New York office.

**This is a full time, in\-office role based in New York City,** and the physical presence is a meaningful part of the job: this person will own the day\-to\-day rhythm of our office environment and ensure it runs seamlessly.


The Executive Assistant will serve as a **force multiplier for Joyful Health's executive team and broader organization** — not just a support function for one leader, but a key operational partner who enables the entire leadership team to operate at their highest leverage. This role is well\-suited for someone proactive, highly organized, and comfortable operating with autonomy in a fast\-paced, growth\-stage startup.

***The base pay range for this role is $80,000 – $95,000 per year.***

Support new hire onboarding to ensure a seamless and professional experience from offer through first week.
* ***Office \& Facilities Management*** Own day\-to\-day office operations: placing lunch orders, coordinating deliveries, stocking snacks and supplies, managing vendor relationships, and maintaining a productive and welcoming in\-office environment. Serve as the on\-the\-ground point of contact for anything the office needs to run well. Support IT setup and maintenance around the office — including phones, TVs, and conference room technology — ensuring equipment is functional and meetings run without friction.
* ***Team \& Event Coordination*** Support onsite and offsite logistics, plan and organize team bonding activities, coordinate swag ordering and distribution, and manage stakeholder gifting. As the team grows, help coordinate competing schedules for company\-wide meetings like All Hands and recurring team meetings.
* ***Go\-to\-Market \& Conference Support*** Support GTM and recruiting events end\-to\-end: sourcing venues, managing logistics, booking travel, coordinating materials and shipments, creating event pages, and tracking prospect and stakeholder meeting logistics.
* ***Meeting Operations*** Set up agendas for recurring operational meetings and track and distribute action items afterward. Support executive calendar management, ensuring leadership priorities are well\-organized and aligned across the team.
* ***Executive \& Communications Support***Draft and manage professional communications to external stakeholders including prospects, partners, and candidates. Support leadership with expense reporting, travel arrangements, and cross\-functional follow\-through.
