Recent client outcomes include:

* **$528K in annual cost reductions** for a **$500M professional services company**
* **$221K in annual cost reductions** for a **$300M healthcare organization**

Spendly is designed to complement finance leaders by providing deep cost analysis, benchmarking, and execution\-ready insights — without adding workload to internal teams.

The Opportunity  
We are seeking experienced **Fractional CFOs, outsourced accounting firms, Controllers, and senior Bookkeepers** to partner with Spendly and introduce our cost reduction capabilities to their client base.

This opportunity is ideal for advisors supporting **companies with $25M\+ in annual revenue** who want to:

* Deliver immediate, tangible ROI to clients
* Expand their advisory value without taking on additional delivery work
* Create incremental, outcome\-based revenue (optional)

This is **not a traditional sales role** and does not require a full\-time commitment.

How the Partnership Works

* You identify client situations where cost reduction, margin improvement, or cash\-flow optimization is a priority
* Spendly performs the detailed analysis and delivers execution\-ready cost reduction recommendations
* Clients realize verified cost savings

You choose how to participate

**Revenue Share Model:** Earn a percentage of *realized savings* created for your clients  
**Client Advantage Model:** Offer your clients preferred pricing or a discounted Spendly engagement

There are no quotas, territories, or minimum activity requirements.

Ideal Backgrounds  
This role is well\-suited for professionals with experience as:

* Fractional or Interim CFOs
* Controllers or Heads of Finance
* Outsourced accounting or advisory firm principals
* Senior bookkeepers supporting mid\-market clients
* Finance advisors to PE\-backed or founder\-led companies

What We’re Looking For

* Active client relationships with companies generating **$25M\+ in annual revenue**
* Trusted advisor role with CEOs, CFOs, or owners
* Comfort reviewing P\&Ls, vendor spend, and operating expenses
* Strong judgment and client\-first mindset
* Interest in outcome\-based value creation

Compensation Structure

* **Revenue Share Option:** Performance\-based compensation tied directly to verified, realized cost savings (no cap)
* **Client Advantage Option:** Preferred pricing or discounts passed directly to clients
* Transparent structure discussed during initial conversations
* No impact on your existing client fee arrangements

Why This Makes Sense for Finance Advisors

* Deliver immediate, provable ROI to clients
* Avoid time\-consuming vendor negotiations and benchmarking work
* Strengthen client retention and trust
* Create incremental revenue without increasing overhead
* Maintain independence and flexibility

Spendly handles the heavy lifting — you stay focused on financial leadership.

How to Apply  
If you currently support mid\-market or enterprise companies and want to expand your advisory impact through measurable cost reduction, we’d welcome a conversation.  
Please include a brief overview of:

* The size and type of companies you support

While a meaningful portion of Vulcury’s current work supports manufacturers and industrial businesses through its subsidiary TrustBridge, the broader growth mandate includes technology\-enabled services, professional services, and investment\-related research and publishing efforts.

  

  

### **Role Overview**

  

Vulcury is seeking a Fractional Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) based in Sydney to provide senior marketing leadership across its multi\-industry portfolio of businesses and engagements.

  

This role is well\-suited for an experienced marketing executive who is comfortable operating across different verticals, business models, and audience types—including B2B services, industrial and manufacturing ecosystems, and financial or investment\-oriented content and platforms.

  

The Fractional CMO will work closely with a CEO based in California, collaborate with senior leaders across Vulcury’s subsidiaries, and oversee a primarily India\-based execution team responsible for day\-to\-day growth activities across channels.

  

This is a hands\-on leadership role, requiring active involvement in strategy, prioritisation, review, and refinement—not merely high\-level advisory input.

  

  

### **Key Responsibilities**

#### **Marketing Strategy \& Leadership**

  

* Define and refine marketing strategies across multiple businesses, industries, and engagement types.
  
* Establish clear growth priorities, sequencing, and success metrics across initiatives.
  
* Balance near\-term demand generation with longer\-term brand and authority building.
  

#### **Channel Oversight \& Execution**

  

Provide senior\-level oversight and guidance across a broad mix of channels, including:

  

* Paid social and digital advertising
  
* SEO and website optimization
  
* Content marketing and thought leadership (blogs, long\-form articles, research\-driven content)
  
* Email campaigns, lifecycle marketing, and SDR\-support workflows
  
* Webinars, podcasts, and virtual events
  
* Media creation and multi\-platform distribution
  

These efforts may support:

  

* Operating businesses within the Vulcury portfolio
  
* External client growth engagements
  
* Investment research, commentary, and financial thought leadership initiatives
  

#### **Team Leadership (India\-Based)**

  

* Lead and mentor a distributed marketing and growth team based primarily in India.
  
* Translate strategic objectives into clear, executable work streams.
  
* Ensure quality, consistency, and performance across channels and verticals.
  

#### **Cross\-Functional \& Cross\-Regional Collaboration**

  

* Interface directly with the U.S.\-based CEO and senior leadership on priorities and performance.
  
* Coordinate with product, sales, research, and operations leaders to ensure alignment.
  
* Adapt messaging and channel strategy to different buyer types, sales cycles, and audiences.
  

#### **Industry\-Specific Context (As Relevant)**

  

* Support initiatives related to manufacturing, supply chain, and industrial services where applicable.
  
* Contribute to growth and content strategies related to financial investments, markets, and research\-driven products.
  
* Adjust marketing approaches to suit technical, regulated, or high\-trust environments.
  

  

### **Engagement Details**

  

* Structure: Fractional / part\-time, scope\-based
  
* Location: Sydney, Australia (remote\-friendly with cross\-time\-zone collaboration)
  
* Travel: Occasional travel may be beneficial but is not required
  

  

  

  

  

  

  

### **Benefits**

### **Why This Role**

  

* Fractional flexibility: Senior\-level influence without full\-time constraint.
  
* Industry breadth: Exposure to multiple sectors, audiences, and growth challenges.
  
* Global collaboration: Work at the intersection of U.S.\-based leadership and India\-based execution.
  
* Substantive impact: Direct ownership of strategy, prioritisation, and execution quality.
  
* Expandable scope: Opportunity to deepen or broaden engagement as Vulcury scales.",,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Vulcury-Venture-Studio-and-Advisors,,,,,,,,,,,,

About WQED
  
  

WQED Multimedia is an iconic public media institution—one of America's original educational broadcasters. Today, we reach hundreds of thousands of neighbors across southwestern Pennsylvania through five broadcast television channels, streaming platforms, 24/7 classical radio, and education and community engagement programs.
  
  

This is a moment of real transformation. With major shifts in media consumption, the launch of new digital products like WQED\+, the elimination of our federal funding, and growing demand for trusted, hopeful, local storytelling, WQED is evolving from a traditional broadcaster into a multi\-platform community resource.
  
  

Joining WQED now means helping shape how Pittsburgh connects through story, culture, and shared experiences—on air, online, and in person.
  
  

The Role
  
  

We are building a small, high\-impact marketing team and are open to hiring at different levels depending on experience and strengths. This full\-time role may be titled Marketing Director or Senior Marketing Manager, and we are open to shaping scope accordingly.
  
  

This is a builder role. We are not looking for someone to inherit a fully formed marketing machine—we're looking for a collaborative leader who enjoys working in a startup\-like environment inside a mission\-driven organization.
  
  

You do not need to be an expert in every channel. You do need to bring:
  
  

* Clear strengths in some areas (campaigns, digital growth, brand, community, events, etc.)
* Curiosity and fluency across others
* Comfort working collaboratively, iteratively, and hands\-on


You will work closely with a small internal team, external partners, and colleagues across programming, sponsorship, education, operations, and development to help WQED grow audience, deepen engagement, and show up more clearly and consistently across the region.
  
  

This is a hybrid role, requiring in\-person collaboration at least three days per week at WQED's studios in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood.
  
  

What You'll Focus On
  
  

**This role centers on a few core outcomes:**  

* Integrated marketing leadership


Help plan and execute coordinated marketing efforts across digital, broadcast, social, email, events, and partnerships—aligned to programming, membership, and community goals.
  
* Growth and engagement


Support audience growth, streaming adoption, and membership by using data, testing, and segmentation to improve how we reach and engage neighbors.
  
* Brand and storytelling


Help express WQED's refreshed, neighborly brand voice across platforms, packaging local stories in ways that feel relevant, welcoming, and human.
  
* Collaboration and operations


Build clear workflows, calendars, and partnerships so marketing efforts are coordinated, realistic, and effective—not siloed or last\-minute.
  
* Team and function building


Contribute to shaping how the marketing team grows over time, including future roles, partners, and tools that complement your strengths.
  
  

What We're Looking For
  
  

**This role may be a good fit if you:**  

* Have significant (8\-12\+ years) experience leading or owning marketing initiatives, with depth in one or more areas (campaigns, digital growth, brand, events, community engagement, etc.)
* Are comfortable both setting direction and rolling up your sleeves
* Enjoy working in environments that are evolving and imperfect
* Are collaborative, curious, and comfortable learning alongside others
* Use data and insights to inform decisions, but don't wait for perfect information
* Care about local storytelling, community connection, and mission\-driven work


We are less interested in checking every box than in finding someone who brings strong fundamentals, clear strengths, and an appetite to help build what's next.
  
  

Required Application Materials
  
  

Cover letter required. Please address the following three prompts:
  
  

* Highlight 2–3 areas of this role where you have the deepest experience and greatest interest.
* Share specific examples of impact you've had in those areas (e.g., growth achieved, programs launched, teams built, audiences reached, innovative breakthroughs, systems improved).
* What excites you most about joining WQED at this moment?


Concise, thoughtful responses are preferred. We value clarity and reflection over length.
  
  

Why This Role Matters
  
  

The person in this role will help shape how WQED shows up to Pittsburgh at a pivotal moment—helping neighbors discover programming, participate in community experiences, and feel connected to a trusted local institution that's evolving for the future.
  
  

Compensation \& Benefits
  
  

This is a full\-time, exempt (salaried) position with a pay range of $65,000 to $90,000 per year, commensurate with experience. Benefits include a PPO health insurance plan; employer\-paid dental, vision, disability, and life insurance; and—after 12 months—a 5% employer contribution to a 403(b) retirement plan.
  
  

Equal Employment Opportunity

**About Fractional AI**


Fractional AI builds bespoke gen AI software to transform businesses. We work with PE\-backed businesses and Fortune 500 clients across industries.


Every C\-suite in the country is trying to bridge the gap between AI in theory and AI in practice. We close this gap with exceptional engineering talent and custom end\-to\-end AI builds (see some of our case studies to learn more).


We are building a rapidly growing business, having doubled in the last quarter alone, and are at the forefront of applied AI. This is a company for intellectually curious individuals looking to make an impact from day 1\.

**About the role**


As an AI Architect at Fractional AI, you are the technical face of our business to prospective clients.


You will combine your technical chops and communication skills to advise stakeholders ranging from CTOs to operational business leaders with limited AI exposure. You will work with our Commercial Leader, CTO, and CEO to craft winning solutions and put structure around ambiguous problems.


Ultimately, clients will get a preview of what it will be like to work with our world\-class applied AI engineering team by engaging with you!

**What you’ll do:**

* **Run discovery \& design workshops** with private equity firms and enterprise prospects, surfacing high‑impact gen AI opportunities, building high\-level roadmaps, and defining requirements
* **Architect robust AI solutions,** articulate trade‑offs, and make recommendations on tools and technologies
* **Define the scope** of implementation projects including timelines, upfront and ongoing cost projections, and risks
* **Develop mockups and prototypes** so clients can visualize the future state before committing to a full build
* **Serve as a technical advisor and thought partner** to clients, including providing insights on trends and the evolving technology landscape
* **Produce persuasive artifacts** including technical briefs, current‑vs‑future process flow diagrams, and a rock‑solid hand‑off package for our delivery teams
* **Bring automation to our GTM motion** wherever you see opportunity

**What you bring to the table:**

* 8\+ years combined experience as a Sales Engineer, Solutions Architect, Deployment Strategist, Software Engineer, and/or Technical Product Manager
* Ability to converse as a peer with senior technical leaders and make complex concepts digestible for AI‑naïve stakeholders.
* You tell crisp, technical stories grounded in relevant anecdotes from your experience with strong presentation skills.
* You thrive in in client\-facing environments
* Fluency in gen AI systems, the AI technology ecosystem, and experience working with LLMs are a bonus

**Snapshot of your first few months:**

* You are in the room with our Commercial Leader on every active sales opportunity
* You are shadowing our delivery team to understand the ins and outs of what we deliver and how
* You start to pitch in on a couple of deals, supporting our CTO and Commercial Leader in the scoping process
* By the end of 60 days, you are owning the technical part of deal cycles and starting to improve our scoping playbook
* By the end of 90 days, you’ll be the smartest person in most rooms on what AI can do for a business

**Why you should (and shouldn’t) join us**


We believe in transparency and know joining a company is a big decision. We’re not the best fit for everyone and try to be clear on what we are and what we’re not so you make the choice that’s right for you.

***Why join Fractional?***

* **A huge and growing problem space:** Getting genAI into production is the challenge of our time – with legacy consulting firms already driving several billion dollars per year on genAI advising revenue. Most offerings on the market don’t meet the need – they are one size fits all product solutions or advising services without the engineering team to deliver. We offer the engineering talent to meet the need.
* **A front\-row seat to the genAI revolution:** The exposure and learnings that you will get around what is real in the world of AI and how enterprises are using this technology to improve their businesses will be unmatched. In a given week you will meet with 10\+ different companies across industries with different use cases. And you will be leading the way to help them figure out how to bring their vision to life.
* **Become an expert:** Your exposure to hundreds of gen AI projects and scoping them will give you a world\-leading vantage point and expertise in the space

***Why shouldn't you join Fractional?***

* **We are unapologetically building an engineering\-first culture** – this is how we build the team to meet the moment. We overdeliver for our clients by crafting a culture that enables the best engineers to thrive.
* **We are a professional services business**. Building for clients and their customers is distinctly different from building for your own product’s customer or users. It’s not for everyone.
* **We are in\-person**. We’re committed to building an in\-person team. This enables us to learn faster together. For the right person, this is a pro, not a con, but it’s non\-negotiable.
* **We meet our clients where they are.** As in\-person collaboration is non\-negotiable internally, the same applies externally. We get far more done when we are in the same room. You should expect to travel about once a month.

**Our Values**


We overdeliver.


We overuse AI.


We “over engineer” the culture.

(Future VP of Behavioral Health)  
Build a Statewide Behavioral Health Division From the Ground Up\*\*  
Bridging Care — Washington State (Remote)

Bridging Care is Washington’s largest provider of community\-based care coordination under the Health Homes Program, serving 2,200\+ Medicaid members across the state. We are rapidly expanding into integrated Behavioral Health — and we’re searching for a rare clinician\-leader who can both serve clients now and build a multi\-million\-dollar statewide BH division within 12–18 months.

This is a ground\-floor, high\-impact, high\-autonomy role for someone who is both a strong clinician and a true builder.  
If you are energized by creating something meaningful, solving complex challenges, and building a Behavioral Health division that improves thousands of lives, this is a career\-defining opportunity.

This role is fully virtual and can be based anywhere in Washington State.

⭐ Your Mission

To serve clients clinically AND design, launch, and scale a statewide, virtual\-first Behavioral Health division — building the systems, workflows, team, and payer relationships needed to create a financially strong program with exceptional clinical quality.

You are not inheriting a system.  
You are building the system.

You will begin hands\-on and grow into the role of General Manager of Behavioral Health as the division becomes profitable.

⭐ What You Will Lead — AND Do

1\. Build \& Launch (Day 1\)

* Lead the creation of our WA State Behavioral Health Agency (BHA) with DOH
* Support King County BH\-ASO contracting
* Support MCO contracting (CHPW, CCW, Molina, UHC, Kaiser, Wellpoint)
* Architect workflows: referral → intake → treatment → billing → QA
* Create documentation templates and clinical standards
* Integrate BH services seamlessly with our 2,200\-member care coordination model

2\. Provide Clinical Services (Bootstrap Phase)

To keep the division cash\-light and self\-funding, you will:

* Carry a caseload of \~15–25 clients/week via telehealth
* Conduct intakes (90791\) and therapy sessions
* Maintain excellent documentation and compliance
* Begin generating revenue immediately while building the division
* This phase lasts only until the program becomes profitable — then your caseload decreases as leadership expands.

3\. Grow \& Scale (Months 4–12\)

* Hire and supervise additional clinicians (initially 1099, then W2\)
* Partner with a fractional prescriber and build an integrated therapy/medication model
* Implement dashboards, KPIs, and scalable processes
* Develop productivity, quality, and financial systems
* Build the foundation of a statewide team

4\. Operate \& Optimize (Months 6–18\)

* Own clinical quality, compliance, documentation standards, and audit readiness
* Manage toward productivity, financial performance, and strong outcomes
* Improve access, reduce no\-show rates, and build a sustainable clinical model
* Serve as the key operational leader for behavioral health
* Prepare for promotion to General Manager of Behavioral Health

⭐ Who You Are

✔ You are BOTH clinical AND operational

You enjoy providing therapy — and you love building systems, workflows, and programs.

✔ You are a builder, not a maintainer

You thrive in environments where you get to create structure, not just follow it.

✔ You think in terms of “Who, not How”

You know how to recruit the right clinicians and build a high\-performing team.

✔ You can talk to payers, regulators, and clinicians

Comfortably covering compliance, documentation, quality, outcomes, workflows, and financial performance.

✔ You are entrepreneurial and mission\-driven

You want to improve lives AND build a sustainable, profitable division.

✔ You are hungry for growth

You want a pathway to become a VP of Behavioral Health — and eventually lead a statewide scalable operation.

⭐ Qualifications

Required:

* WA license: LMHC, LMFT, LCSW/LICSW

(Must possess an active unrestricted license to practice in the state of Washington).

* Strong outpatient therapy experience
* Strong documentation \& compliance skillset
* Comfort balancing clinical work and program\-building
* Experience with telehealth
* Strong leadership instincts; desire to scale a team
* Operational thinking: processes, systems, workflows, KPIs

Preferred but not required:

* Experience with WA Medicaid, MCOs, or BH\-ASO
* Experience with DOH licensing or audits
* Experience leading teams or mentoring clinicians
* Experience in startups, integrated care, community mental health, or multidisciplinary settings

⭐ Compensation

Base Salary:

$100,000 – $135,000 (DOE, aligned with bootstrap phase)

→ Early earning potential: $120k–$150k\+

Career Path:

Clear progression to:

Director → VP of Behavioral Health  
with expanded salary, reduced caseload, and a full team under you.

Future Upside:

* Leadership development support
* Ability to build and run a multi\-million\-dollar statewide division

Benefits:

Remote work (anywhere in WA) **Medical/Dental/Vision**  PTO **Technology stipend**

⭐ Why Join Bridging Care?

You will be the founding architect of a major new service line for one of Washington’s fastest\-growing care organizations. You will have:

* A massive built\-in referral base
* Strong MCO relationships
* Full executive support
* A statewide virtual infrastructure
* True autonomy and creativity
* A real pathway to run this division as VP
* The chance to impact thousands of lives
* The opportunity to build one of WA’s most impactful BH programs

Endeavor TBD is operating the search and selection process for Durant Bailey, The Equity Brain Trust and Endeavor TBD. We are an operations firm for the socially\-vested and assist clients who have a purpose beyond profit with their operational needs.

**Position Overview**

We’re looking for an Executive Assistant (EA) to support three CEOs leading growing, mission\-driven organizations. This role is central to how we work—and it’s part of a *shared services model* we’re intentionally testing and learning from. Our hope is that, if done well, this model can offer a thoughtful, sustainable way for organizations to access high\-level executive support.

The three CEOs you’ll support are deeply collaborative, socially invested, and actively building organizations that aim to have real impact. We’re looking for a partner\-minded EA who can provide the kind of high\-trust, high\-level support that allows us to operate at the next level.

Day to day, this role keeps work moving and leaders focused—managing calendars and inboxes, coordinating logistics, tracking commitments, and ensuring follow\-through. But it goes beyond task management. We’re looking for someone who owns the thinking behind the work: anticipating needs, noticing patterns, improving systems, and making thoughtful decisions about priorities and flow.

This is a shared services role, which means you’ll be technically employed by Endeavor TBD while supporting three leaders across related organizations. You’ll balance time and priorities across them, build trusted relationships with each, and help create consistency across how work gets done.

The right person enjoys staying a step ahead, bringing order to complexity, and taking responsibility for outcomes—not just activities. The work blends strong administrative skills with judgment, planning, and proactive coordination, and it’s well\-suited for someone who likes being relied on and trusted.

ATAK Interactive is a HubSpot partner agency specializing in the technical implementations most agencies avoid—complex HubSpot\-Salesforce integrations, M\&A platform transitions, and enterprise system migrations that require both strategic thinking and technical precision. We solve hard problems for companies that need systems to actually work, not just look good in a demo.

### **The Role**


The HubSpot Sales Executive is a hunter responsible for driving new business growth across two primary channels: direct prospecting and strategic channel partnerships, particularly co\-selling relationships with HubSpot sales representatives who need a trusted partner for complex deals.


You'll own the full sales cycle—from identifying opportunities and leading discovery to coordinating scoping solutions and closing contracts. You'll be selling custom implementations, system integrations, and strategic solutions that solve real revenue problems for mid\-market and enterprise clients.


The opportunity for growth is real: Success in this role creates a clear path to building and leading a sales team as ATAK scales. We're looking for someone who can not only hunt and close but who wants to eventually recruit, mentor, and manage other sellers as the company grows.

### **What You'll Do**

### **Hunt and Close New Business**

* Develop and execute outbound prospecting strategies targeting companies with complex HubSpot implementation needs—M\&A transitions, Salesforce migrations, enterprise integrations
* Execute multi\-channel outreach (email, phone, LinkedIn, video) to generate qualified pipeline
* Lead consultative discovery calls with VPs of Sales, Marketing, and RevOps to diagnose technical pain points and revenue challenges
* Build and nurture a pipeline of channel partners such as HubSpot reps, Fractional CMOs, Business Coaches, and other software representatives.
* Deliver high\-impact presentations that clearly articulate ATAK's differentiated value in solving complex technical problems
* Work with the delivery team to scope detailed Statements of Work for technical implementations, managing pricing negotiations and contract terms
* Drive full\-cycle revenue generation against an annual quota of $1m\+

### **Build Strategic HubSpot Channel Relationships**

* Cultivate co\-selling relationships with HubSpot Growth Specialists, Service Consultants, and Territory Managers who need a partner for technical deals
* Position ATAK as the ""go\-to"" agency for complex implementations within the HubSpot sales organization
* Respond immediately to ""Partner Assisted"" leads, recognizing that speed\-to\-lead maintains trust with referring HubSpot reps
* Conduct regular account mapping sessions with HubSpot partners to identify overlapping target accounts and coordinate joint outreach
* Register partner\-sourced deals properly within the HubSpot Partner Portal to ensure proper attribution
* Represent ATAK at INBOUND and other industry events

### **Manage Your Pipeline Like a Pro**

* Maintain rigorous pipeline hygiene in our HubSpot CRM, ensuring deal stages, close dates, and values reflect reality
* Apply strict qualification criteria (budget, authority, need, timeline, technical fit) to validate opportunities
* Monitor conversion rates through the funnel and adjust sales behaviors to improve efficiency
* Present accurate pipeline forecasts to leadership
* Ensure seamless handoffs to delivery teams with clear documentation of client requirements and success metrics

### **Stay Sharp and Build Expertise**

* Work with specialists to maintain knowledge of the HubSpot platform, staying ahead of product updates and new features
* Understand the competitive landscape (Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, other HubSpot partners) to effectively differentiate ATAK's technical capabilities
* Collaborate with technical teams during pre\-sales to ensure proposed solutions are scoped correctly, profitable, and achievable

### **Who You Are**

### **Required**

* Experience: 3\+ years in B2B sales, ideally selling professional services, HubSpot implementations, or technical solutions
* Hunter Mentality: Proven track record generating at least 60\-70% of your own pipeline through outbound prospecting and relationship building
* HubSpot Partner Experience: Previous experience working in the HubSpot ecosystem
* Channel Sales Understanding: Experience selling with or through software partner ecosystems, building co\-selling relationships that drive mutual revenue
* Technical Comfort: Ability to discuss complex technical requirements with confidence—integrations, data migrations, system architecture—without needing to defer everything to technical teams
* Consultative Selling: Strong discovery skills and the ability to diagnose root\-cause business problems rather than just responding to surface\-level requests
* Executive Presence: Comfortable commanding conversations with C\-level executives and managing complex, multi\-stakeholder negotiations
* HubSpot CRM Proficiency: Expert\-level pipeline management and familiarity with sales tools (Sales Hub, ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator)

### **Preferred**

* Active HubSpot certifications
* Existing relationships within the HubSpot sales organization
* Experience selling technical implementations, integrations, or migration services
* Track record of hitting or exceeding quota in a hunter role",,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Atak-Interactive,,https://www.atakinteractive.com,Los Angeles,2 to 10,less than $1M (USD),,,,,,,
