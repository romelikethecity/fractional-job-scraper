iota Biosciences, a wholly owned subsidiary of Astellas Pharma US, is advancing a new class of bioelectronic medicines through the development of fully implantable Class III medical devices. Our proprietary technologies open therapeutic and diagnostic possibilities not previously accessible to clinicians.  

  

Together with Astellas, we are committed to patient\-centric design, scientific and engineering excellence, and cross\-functional teamwork. These principles guide us in bringing transformative, first\-of\-its\-kind technologies into the clinic and closer to patients.

**About the Role**


iota is looking for a hands\-on finance leader who thrives in early\-stage environments and wants to build. This role is ideal for a senior staff accountant or early FP\&A professional who has a strong foundation in accounting but also wants to step into broader ownership of budgeting, burn\-rate tracking, process creation, and day\-to\-day financial operations.


You will be responsible for the day\-to\-day finance function, working closely with our fractional CFO and leadership team to establish the systems, processes, and financial discipline needed to scale a new venture. This is a highly visible, cross\-functional role with a real opportunity to shape how the company grows.

**What You’ll Do**


Financial Operations \& Accounting

* Oversee day\-to\-day accounting operations, including AP, month\-end close, reconciliations, and journal entries.
* Partner with external accounting and PEO teams to ensure accurate payroll, benefits, payroll tax processes and day\-to\-day accounting.
* Maintain the general ledger and ensure compliance with US GAAP.
* Support monthly, quarterly, and annual financial statements; prepare flux analysis; prepare schedules for audits and reviews.
* Manage the company’s use tax compliance, including preparing, documenting, and filing periodic returns. Work with the tax firm to support additional filings such as business property tax and franchise tax.


Budgeting, Forecasting \& Reporting

* Build and manage budgets in partnership with department leads and the fractional CFO; provide real\-time visibility into actuals vs. budget.
* Track and forecast burn rate, headcount costs, vendor spend, and runway—proactively flagging risks and insights.
* Develop dashboards and reporting that help leadership make informed decisions.


Systems, Processes \& Internal Controls

* Implement early financial systems, tools, and scalable processes (e.g., expense management, purchasing flows, cost tracking).
* Create simple but effective internal controls appropriate for an early\-stage company.
* Lead vendor onboarding and contract tracking; partner with legal and operations teams as needed.
* Creating and updating expense and travel policies and maintaining internal compliance.


Cross\-Functional Support

* Work closely with R\&D, Clinical, Operations, and HR to align finance with business needs.
* Help model scenarios for hiring, lab expansion, grants, capital planning, and investment decisions.
* Support board reporting, investor updates, and fundraising preparation.

**Who You Are**

* 5–8 years of accounting experience (startup or high\-growth environment strongly preferred).
* Strong understanding of US GAAP with hands\-on accounting capability—but also excited to expand into FP\&A.
* Scrappy, detail\-oriented, and comfortable wearing many hats—this role spans accounting, operations, and finance strategy.
* Someone who wants to *own* the finance function day\-to\-day, not just support it.
* Comfortable with ambiguity, building processes from scratch, and creating structure where none exists.
* Experience with finance systems; QuickBooks and Ramp a plus.

**Why This Role Is Exciting**

* You’ll be joining at the formation stage of a new, well\-funded company—your work will directly influence how the company grows.
* You’ll partner closely with experienced leaders (CEO, COO, fractional CFO) and gain exposure to strategic decision\-making.
* You’ll build foundational systems from the ground up, not inherit legacy processes.
* Clear growth path into Finance Manager or Controller as the company scales.

Growth Stage Controller: Build the Future of Finance at 2\-5 Hypergrowth Companies  


  

Embedded Teams \+ AI\-Enabled Intelligence  


  

In 24 months, you'll gain experience that would take 5\-7 years in a single\-company role. You'll serve as Controller for 2\-5 Series B\-C companies simultaneously—each with $20M\-$200M\+ in revenue, complex operations, and boards that demand excellence. You'll have the stability, resources and infrastructure of a 17 year old, 250\-person firm and you'll receive training in AI\-enabled financial intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else.  


  

This is foundational work—and it's the future.  


  

Nearly 17 years ago, we set out to find a better way to help the country's leading startups navigate the financial hazards that follow their first institutional funding.  


  

Today, Propeller's 250\+ full\-time professionals across three continents serve as the embedded finance and accounting partner to some of the most iconic emerging companies in Consumer, Technology, Blockchain, and Business Services.  


  

**Our embedded teams integrate seamlessly into client operations in multi\-year partnerships.** You'll attend weekly leadership meetings, participate in board prep, collaborate on strategic decisions, and have direct access to client CEOs and CFOs. This embedded positioning creates trust, access and influence that traditional providers never achieve.  


  

With our Financial Operating Platform—combining human judgment, precise accounting, data infrastructure, and AI\-enabled insight—**we transform finance from a back\-office function into the central nervous system of growth.**  

* Experience 2\-5 business models, GTM strategies, and leadership styles simultaneously
* Navigate wins and lessons\-learned across multiple companies and multiple stages
* Index clients against Propeller’s stage\-specific benchmarks to develop context for your instincts
* Regular interaction with Series B and C CFOs, CEOs, and stakeholders
* Present financials and strategic recommendations to sophisticated audiences
* Build relationships that become your professional network for life
* Hands\-on experience with Propeller's Intelligence Engine (PIE) and Data Lake (PDL)
* Learn to leverage systems and automation that transforms patterns into predictions
* Prepare for the future of finance while others react to it
* 17\-year\-old firm with strong balance sheet, 250 people and competitive compensation
* None of the startup risk, all of the upside learning
* Infrastructure and support that solo controllers rarely have
* Propeller alumni have gone on to earn CFO and controller roles at multiple unicorns and nine\-figure companies—**this role is a launchpad, not a landing pad**


  

Let's be direct about what it takes to succeed here:  


  

You'll juggle 2\-5 clients with different fiscal calendars, reporting requirements, board schedules, and growth stages. Without systematic thinking and disciplined execution, you'll drown. If you prefer improvisation over process, this isn't your role.  


  

You'll receive direct feedback frequently from senior controllers, CFO partners, and clients. Your ability to implement it quickly determines your success. If you need to be right more than you need to get better, this isn't your role.  


  

No lone wolves. You're building systems that outlive any individual engagement. Your insights become institutional knowledge. Your workflows help the next controller scale faster. If you hoard knowledge or prefer solo work, this isn't your role.  


  

Month\-end close means 2\-5 companies close simultaneously. Series B CFOs and boards expect precision, timeliness, and strategic perspective. If you prefer predictable 9\-5 rhythms, this isn't your role.  


  

Every client teaches something new. Technology platforms evolve. AI tools advance almost daily. Industry dynamics shift. If you prefer mastery through repetition over growth through challenge, this isn't your role.  


  

The Controller at Propeller builds systems that turn financial data into strategic foresight. You'll lead engagement teams to deliver month\-end closes with excellence while transforming traditional controller work—historically reactive and backward\-looking—into a proactive, AI\-enabled function that surfaces insights before problems arise.### **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Oversee engagement teams across U.S. and international personnel, delegating work to maximize efficiency
* Mentor and develop team members, actively supporting professional growth
* Manage utilization and client load to ensure team members are challenged, supported, and operating at optimal capacity
* Codify and share best practices, contributing to Propeller's institutional knowledge and platform intelligence
* Optimize margins and business unit efficiency, recognizing that Propeller's economics shift from hours billed to value delivered
* Proactively engage in Early Warning processes to surface issues before they escalate
* Support client pipeline development in collaboration with Business Development, CFO team, and Customer Experience
* Identify upsell and lifecycle extension opportunities by understanding client needs and demonstrating incremental value
* Partner with Customer Success to ensure deliverables meet Propeller's standards and drive client satisfaction
* Conduct periodic client file reviews to identify learning opportunities, develop best practices, and feed insights back into the platform
* Document workflows and surface repeatable intelligence that can be systematized through PropellerOS
* Drive high client satisfaction by delivering not just accurate financials, but timely, actionable insights
* Transform the monthly close call from backward\-looking reporting into strategic financial review powered by analytics and CFO perspective
* Develop scope and service offerings for potential Growth Stage clients
* Participate in all phases of the client conversion cycle: scoping, pitch, and SOW development
* Act as a strategic partner to executive teams, helping them navigate financial and operational complexity
* **Master's Degree or CPA required**
* **7\+ years in accounting/finance** with at least 3 years at companies or serving clients in the $10M\-$100M revenue range
* **Multi\-client or consulting background strongly preferred** (Big 4, boutique accounting firm, fractional CFO services, or similar)
* Demonstrated ability to **build processes from scratch**—not just follow them
* Cross\-functional experience developing processes around financial reporting and operational workflows
* Previous experience with Series B and Series C companies
* Strong understanding of how operational and business changes impact financial reporting
* Experience with investor diligence and audit preparedness
* Quickbooks


  

Consumer:  

  

  

* In\-depth understanding of inventory flow and cost accounting
* Experience with DTC and wholesale channels
* Strong knowledge of ASC 606 and revenue recognition
* Familiarity with sales tax implications and obligations
* Ability to distinguish between COGS and Opex

  

  

  

  

Enterprise/Technology:  

  

  

* Experience with revenue waterfalls and deferred revenue
* Solid understanding of ASC 606 and revenue recognition
* Familiarity with sales tax obligations
* Ability to identify capitalizable costs and correctly allocate to COGS or Opex
* Systems thinking: ability to see patterns, codify intelligence, and contribute to scalable, repeatable processes
* Comfort with ambiguity and change: Propeller is building the future of professional services, and this role requires adaptability, curiosity, and willingness to pioneer new approaches
* Technical aptitude: experience with modern tools like Claude Code, Databricks, Looker, N8N, or similar platforms

We’re building a new **B2B CRM** and are approaching our first launch. The product is nearly complete, development is handled, and we’re now looking for an experienced **Product Marketing / Go\-To\-Market consultant** to help us shape how this product is positioned, branded, and introduced to the market.

This is a **pre\-launch, early\-stage engagement**. There is no marketing team yet — you’ll be working directly with the founder to define the foundation.

This role is ideal for someone who has helped launch SaaS products before and enjoys turning complex products into clear, compelling market stories.

What You’ll Do

**Brand \& Positioning**

* Review and sanity\-check existing branding (logo, name, tone, visual direction)
* Ensure brand aligns with target customer expectations and trust signals
* Recommend improvements only where necessary (no unnecessary rebrands)

**Product Messaging \& Vision**

* Clarify ideal customer profile (ICP) and core use case
* Define the product’s primary value proposition and differentiation
* Translate founder vision into clear, customer\-facing messaging
* Help craft homepage headlines, pitch narrative, and demo story

**Go\-To\-Market Strategy**

* Define initial go\-to\-market plan for launch
* Recommend pricing posture, trial vs demo approach, and early traction strategy
* Identify the most realistic early acquisition channels
* Create a simple, focused launch roadmap (lean, not flashy)

**Founder Collaboration**

* Act as a strategic partner and thought partner
* Ask tough questions and challenge assumptions when needed
* Help avoid common early\-stage SaaS marketing mistakes

What We’re Looking For

**Required Experience**

* Proven experience in **Product Marketing, GTM, or Fractional CMO roles**
* Background in **B2B SaaS** (CRM experience is a strong plus)
* Experience launching products from **pre\-launch to first customers**
* Strong positioning, messaging, and market\-strategy skills

**Nice to Have**

* Experience working with early\-stage founders
* Familiarity with founder\-led sales or early revenue validation
* Ability to balance strategy with practical execution

What This Is (and Isn’t)

**This is:**

* Strategic, hands\-on, early\-stage work
* High\-impact foundational role
* Flexible, fractional, short\-term engagement (with potential to extend)

**This is NOT:**

* A social media or content posting role
* A junior marketing position
* A large\-budget brand redesign project

**Company:** Purrfect Portal  
**Location:** Remote (US\-based preferred)  
**Reports to:** Founder \& CEO (Lisa Harrington)

About Purrfect Portal

Purrfect Portal is a fast\-growing omnichannel consumer brand serving passionate pet owners through DTC, Amazon, Chewy, and future national retail partners. The company is entering a multi\-year scale phase with ambitions for significant channel expansion, product innovation, and long\-term enterprise value creation.

The Role

We are seeking a hands\-on, execution\-oriented COO to own operational leadership, channel performance, and cross\-functional alignment. This role is responsible for translating strategy into reality and ensuring the business can scale profitably and predictably.

This is a builder role — ideal for an operator who thrives in growth\-stage environments and enjoys creating clarity out of complexity.

Core Responsibilities

Channel Operations \& Performance

* Own operational performance across **Amazon, Shopify, and Chewy**
* Ensure inventory availability, launch readiness, and promotional execution
* Coordinate with internal teams responsible for listings, marketing, and fulfillment
* Act as escalation point for operational or channel issues impacting revenue
* Establish clear ownership, workflows, and accountability across channels

Retail \& Channel Growth

* Lead strategy and execution for **2027 Big Box Retail launch**, from internal readiness through launch execution
* Lead operational planning for first\-time retail launches, including forecasting, inventory risk management, and cash\-flow implications
* Manage retailer.com expansion and ensure cross\-functional readiness
* Coordinate execution with brokers, buyers, and external partners
* Define and document workflows between internal teams, brokers, and retailers
* Ensure ecommerce and retail channels can scale simultaneously without destabilizing the core business

EAM Leadership \& Cross\-Functional Alignment

* Build and own SOPs, workflows, and accountability systems
* Align operations, marketing, fulfillment, finance, and admin
* Implement operating rhythms, KPIs, and reporting
* Design a scalable org structure tied to revenue milestones
* Reduce founder dependency through clear ownership and systems

Operations \& Production

* Own day\-to\-day factory and production operations (US\-based manufacturing)
* Manage production timelines, POs, quality control, and issue resolution
* Translate inventory strategy into executable manufacturing plans
* Partner closely with inventory planning lead on forecasting, reorders, and risk mitigation

Who You Are

* Proven operator in ecommerce or omnichannel consumer brands
* **Has led an ecommerce or DTC\-first brand through successful retail expansion** (e.g., Walmart, Target, specialty retail)
* Deep understanding of how retail impacts inventory planning, cash flow, margins, and operations
* Experience working with brokers, buyers, and retail operations teams
* Comfortable with ambiguity and building systems from scratch
* Strong communicator with factories, partners, and internal teams
* Systems\-minded but deeply execution\-oriented
* Able to balance strategic thinking with hands\-on follow\-through
* Calm under pressure and confident owning decisions

Required Experience

* 8–15 years operating experience in ecommerce and/or consumer brands
* **Direct experience launching and scaling at least one brand into brick\-and\-mortar or national retail**
* Experience managing complexity across DTC, marketplaces, and wholesale channels
* Experience owning or partnering closely on operations, supply chain, and channel execution

Role Structure \& Time Commitment

This role will begin as a **fractional COO position**, averaging **20–25 hours per week**.

Hours may flex higher during onboarding, systems build\-out, or key initiatives (e.g., production transitions or retail readiness), and lighter during steady\-state periods.

As the business scales — particularly with increased retail complexity, team growth, or active national retail launches — this role may evolve into a **full\-time position by mutual agreement**.

What This Role Is Not

* Not a corporate or big\-company COO role with existing infrastructure
* Not a passive advisor or strategy\-only position
* Not a pure supply chain or inventory\-planning role
* Not a marketing, growth, or paid media role
* Not a 9–5, task\-ticket–driven job

This role is for an operator who wants ownership, accountability, and real impact in a growing consumer brand.

What Success Looks Like (12–18 Months)

* Day\-to\-day operations run without founder involvement
* Production and inventory execution are predictable and well\-documented
* Channel performance is stable, visible, and accountable
* Retail expansion initiatives are operationally sound and execution\-ready
* The organization operates with clear roles, workflows, and metrics
* The business is prepared to scale retail without compromising core ecommerce performance

Pay: $50,000\.00 \- $100,000\.00 per year

Benefits:

* Flexible schedule

We are seeking a Fractional Chief Business Officer (CBO) to serve as the Company’s Integrator — a senior operator who can bring structure, accountability, and execution across multiple business units while partnering directly with the CEO.

* Comfortable in founder\-led, high\-accountability environments
* Decisive, structured, and execution\-oriented
* High emotional intelligence and strong communication skills

Experience in real estate, multi\-entity organizations, or private equity\-backed environments is a strong plus.

**Engagement Structure**

* Fractional, 1099 engagement

* You are primarily an advisor or consultant
* You are uncomfortable making decisions
* You prefer highly structured corporate environments
* You avoid accountability or ambiguity

**Why This Opportunity**

This is a chance to help build the operational backbone of a growing enterprise, work directly with an engaged founder, and potentially step into a long\-term executive leadership role.

If you are an operator who enjoys building, fixing, and scaling — we want to talk.

* **Data Analysis:** Ability to analyze data, documents, reports, etc., with meticulous attention to detail.
