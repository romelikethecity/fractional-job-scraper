The Role

* Ensure financial practices meet nonprofit compliance standards and funder expectations
* Guide the organization toward audit\-readiness as funding grows

Strategic Finance

* Provide financial perspective on key organizational decisions (hiring plans, vendor spend, program investments)
* Advise on cash flow management, runway planning, and funding milestone mapping
* Help model financial scenarios to support strategic planning and board discussions

Ideal Background

We’re looking for a senior finance leader who’s comfortable in lean, mission\-driven environments. You may be a great fit if you have:

* 10\+ years of experience in finance, accounting, or financial leadership
* Prior experience as a CFO, VP Finance, Controller, or Finance Director — ideally with nonprofit or startup exposure
* Familiarity with nonprofit budgeting, fund accounting, and foundation/grant reporting requirements
* Strong ability to translate financial data into clear, credible narratives for non\-financial stakeholders
* Experience supporting fundraising efforts, grant applications, or investor/funder due diligence
* Pragmatic, low\-ego communication style — comfortable advising in a fast\-moving volunteer environment
* Interest in mission\-driven, nonpartisan, or civic\-oriented work

CPA, nonprofit audit experience, or experience with organizations scaling from early\-stage to $1M\+ in philanthropic funding is a plus, but not required.

Why This Role Matters

* You’ll help VoteMate present itself as a financially credible, fundable organization to major foundations
* Your budget work will directly support funding conversations that determine the organization’s trajectory
* You’ll shape how a growing nonprofit builds its financial foundation for long\-term sustainability
* You’ll work closely with an experienced founder and a committed volunteer leadership team

**Workplace Type:** Primarily in\-office (at least 4 days per week)

**Department:** Onboarding

**Who is The Charity CFO, LLC?**

The Charity CFO is a nationally recognized accounting and advisory firm exclusively serving nonprofit organizations. We partner with mission\-driven leaders to provide fractional CFO services, outsourced accounting, and strategic financial guidance that helps nonprofits grow sustainably, remain compliant, and make confident, data\-informed decisions.

Our work goes beyond bookkeeping and compliance. We act as trusted financial partners to nonprofit CEOs, boards, and leadership teams \- helping organizations strengthen financial infrastructure, improve transparency, and align financial strategy with mission impact.

Through our fractional CFO model, we bring senior\-level financial expertise to nonprofits that may not need or be able to afford a full\-time CFO. Our clients rely on us for budgeting and forecasting, audit readiness, grant compliance, financial storytelling, and long\-term financial planning.

At The Charity CFO, we value clarity, accountability, and generosity. We believe strong financial leadership is a catalyst for stronger missions, healthier teams, and greater community impact.

Our culture is grounded in three core values: Lead with Generosity, Own It and Grow, and Radical Transparency. These values shape how we work together, serve our nonprofit clients, and make decisions as a firm.

We believe generosity shows up through support, collaboration, and a willingness to help others succeed. We assume positive intent, create space for growth, and go the extra mile for our clients and each other.

We take ownership of our work and our outcomes. Mistakes are expected; learning is required. We value people who follow through, seek feedback, and are committed to continuous improvement \- both personally and professionally.

We value clear, honest, and timely communication. We share information openly, address challenges directly, and do the right thing even when it’s uncomfortable. Transparency builds trust with our clients, our teammates, and our leadership.

At The Charity CFO, we believe clarity is a form of respect, accountability enables growth, and strong financial leadership helps nonprofit missions thrive. We look for people who align with these values and are excited to contribute to a thoughtful, high\-performing, and mission\-driven firm.

Malloy Industries connects B2B CEOs (typically $1M–$50M revenue, 10–100 employees) with vetted fractional executives who help bring structure to chaos. We’re known for being relentlessly generous, vulnerably trustworthy, enthusiastically fun, independently productive, and flexibly learning—and we take client outcomes seriously.

We’re expanding our Fractional Executive Network and are looking for experienced Fractional COOs / Directors of Operations to join our roster for potential client collaborations.

Important: This is NOT a full\-time job

Malloy Industries is building our Fractional Executive Roster. This posting is for experienced operations leaders who want to be considered for future fractional client engagements. If you’re looking for a W\-2, full\-time internal role, this won’t be the right fit.

**The Opportunity (Fractional / Contract)**  
Our clients are growth\-stage founders who need a strategic finance partner—someone who can align money with goals and help them move from reactive to proactive decision\-making.

As a roster member, you may be matched with US\-based clients for fractional engagements—often 5–20 hours/week depending on needs.

While we can’t guarantee a specific volume of client work, members join because we invest in their success with meaningful support and a strong matching process.

* Create board\-level reporting and a clear financial narrative
* Provide growth and pricing guidance tied to profitability and cash
* Partner with the CEO on strategic decisions (hiring plans, investment tradeoffs, risk)
* Lead and develop the finance function (guiding controller/accounting/bookkeeping resources as needed)

**Who This Is For (and who it’s not)**  
This roster is for CFO\-level leaders who can drive strategic clarity and executive\-level decision support.

**This is NOT a bookkeeping\-only or AP/AR\-only role.**

**Must\-haves**

* 8\+ years in finance/accounting with senior leadership scope (CFO, VP Finance, Finance Director, or equivalent)
* Experience supporting founder\-led or scaling businesses (roughly 10–100 employees)
* Strong communication skills (you can explain financial reality to non\-finance leaders clearly)
* Comfortable working independently in a fractional/consulting\-style environment
* US\-based; able to work remotely with US clients

**Strongly preferred**

* Cash forecasting experience (including 13\-week cash flow)
* Fundraising readiness support (modeling, metrics, data room financials)
* Board reporting experience

**Benefits of Joining the Malloy Industries Network**

* Qualified lead pipeline delivering pre\-vetted, growth\-stage companies ready to collaborate
* Seamless back\-office support that handles all contracts, invoicing, and payment processing
* Active success partnership featuring weekly check\-ins to support you and monthly client reviews to protect your work
* Maximized earning potential by eliminating business development costs and friction

**Compensation**  
Compensation varies by client engagement and scope and will be discussed during the matching process.

**How to Apply**   
Applications are only accepted through our apply page and roundtable process. (required)

**Step 1: RSVP to “Explore Collaborations” (Executive Roundtable)**  
This is the essential first step. Once a month, we host a roundtable to personally meet potential members.

* You’ll introduce yourself and your services to our team
* We’ll explain our business model, the mutual referral agreement, and how we support our executives
* We decide together if there’s a mutual fit for collaboration

This is a conversation, not an interrogation.

### **Summary**


* **Flexible Title:** Can tailor to reflect your skills \& experience.
* **Flexible Time:** Can do full\-time, part\-time, side\-gig (off\-hours), or fractional (contract).
* **Flexible Commitment:** Can do short\-term, long\-term, or intermittent.


**Why so flexible?** We're a FUNDED startup racing to launch end of Q1 2026\. That gives us just 3 months to stack features while raising additional working capital. Feel free to jump in, help us ship, then bounce \>\> or stick around. A successful launch translates into lots of permanent jobs for those that want them. We're also interested in long term ""side gig"" relationships, if that's what you're into \- in our experience, a few expert hours often beat full\-time learning\-curve hours.


### **About Us**


We're a credible, **funded**, remote\-first startup led by a serial \[technical] founder, and backed by a 20\-person team. The product is live in private alpha.


Learn more about our founder, team, and comp structures at **list\-lab.org**.


### **About The Role**


Can be a **purely management role** or a **hands\-on coding \+ management hybrid**. Either way, you must be deeply fluent in Rails and React — strong enough to spot\-check code quality and call BS on padded estimates or sandbagged velocity.


### **Compensation**


Up to **$400,000** max total compensation in Tier 1 cities; cash and equity components to be negotiated (amount reflects combined cash and equity components).


### **What Success Looks Like in 30 Days**


Many devs are currently using AI to achieve the same outcome with 70% less work. We want you to achieve the opposite: same effort, higher velocity.


* You've established yourself as the alpha nerd, and are running regular 1:1s with each developer
* You've established a positive culture that devs WANT to be part of
* You've established processes that ensure AI is being used to compound output
* You're holding the team accountable to the standard you've set


### **What You'll Do**


* Lead and manage a team of developers building on Ruby on Rails and React
* **Drive AI enablement across the organization** — integrate AI into the product, engineering workflows, and non\-technical processes to maximize output and efficiency
* Establish and track performance metrics for individual contributors and the team as a whole

The CEO builds working prototypes with Claude Code. The fractional CTO literally wrote the book on enterprise vibe coding. We need an engineer to own the entire technology stack and turn POCs into production systems.  

  

If that sounds exciting, keep reading. If it sounds terrifying, this isn't for you.  

  

**What This Actually Is**  

Schneiders Saddlery is a 75\-year\-old family business that refuses to operate like one. Modern stack (Shopify Plus, cloud ERP, BigQuery, AWS). No legacy debt after our current migration. No bureaucracy. No red tape.  

**Your job:** Build AI systems that automate routine business operations. Customer service inquiries. Inventory reconciliation. Marketing execution. Pricing analysis. Reporting and analytics. Free our team from repetitive tasks so they can focus on what requires human judgment.  

**Your tools:** Claude Code. Cursor. Modern AI. If your AI experience is limited to ChatGPT prompts or Copilot autocomplete, this isn't the right fit.  

**Your access:** Direct line to CEO and leadership team. Weekly strategy sessions. Real decisions, not ticket queues.  

**Your support:** Our fractional CTO has a battle\-tested methodology for AI\-native development. He'll teach you the system, review architecture, and provide guidance. Not micromanagement \- expertise when you need it.  

**Who This Is For**  

You're a senior engineer who has figured out that AI changes everything. You've developed your own systematic approach to AI development \- requirements, design, implementation, review \- and you ship fast.  

You understand business processes. Not just code. You look at how a company operates and see automation opportunities everywhere. You ask ""why does a human do this?"" before you ask ""how do I build this?""  

You have real e\-commerce experience. Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce \- you've built on platforms, not just used them. You understand orders, inventory, customers, integrations.  

You're comfortable with ambiguity. The CEO will hand you a working prototype and say ""make this production."" You'll figure out what that means.  

**Who This Is NOT For*** You need detailed specifications before you start work
* You think AI is overhyped or ""just autocomplete""
* You've never worked in e\-commerce
* You want to manage a team, not write code
* ""Figure it out"" makes you anxious
* Your AI workflow is copy\-paste from ChatGPT

**The Stack****Layer** **Technology**  


E\-commerce Shopify Plus  


ERP Fulfil.io (Python APIs)

**The Bigger Opportunity:** We're building AI automation tools for our business. They work. Our friends in e\-commerce want them too. The right person becomes an equity partner in a separate AI automation venture. We productize what you build and sell it. You helped build it, you own part of it.  

  

This isn't a vague ""equity potential"" line. This is a real conversation for the right candidate.

**About Schneiders Saddlery**  

  

Family\-owned since 1948, Schneiders Saddlery is a profitable mid\-8\-figure e\-commerce company serving the equestrian market. We're modernizing our technology stack and building AI systems to automate business operations.  

  

We operate differently: modern stack (Shopify Plus, BigQuery, AWS), no legacy technical debt, direct access to leadership, and a culture where engineers own outcomes, not tickets.

**What Makes This Role Different*** **AI\-Native Development Required:** We use Claude Code and Cursor for 100% of code generation. You must have an established AI development workflow \- not just autocomplete, but directing AI to build complete systems.
* **E\-Commerce Experience Required:** You've built on Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, or similar platforms. You understand orders, inventory, customers, and integrations at a technical level.
* **Direct Business Impact:** No layers between you and leadership. Your work directly affects company operations. You'll automate processes that currently require manual effort.
* **CEO Who Codes:** The CEO builds working prototypes with Claude Code. You'll turn his POCs into production systems. This requires someone comfortable with ambiguity.

**The Stack*** E\-commerce: Shopify Plus
* ERP: Fulfil.io (Python APIs)
* Data: BigQuery, Fivetran
* Frontend: React, Next.js
* AI: Claude Code, Anthropic APIs
* Infrastructure: AWS, Terraform, CI/CD

* Performance bonus up to 100% of base
* Health, dental, vision insurance
* 401(k) with company match
* Remote work
* Equity path for exceptional performance

**Career Growth**  

This role has significant upside beyond salary:* Direct equity path for the right candidate
* Opportunity to become partner in AI automation venture
* Build products that get sold to other e\-commerce companies

**Interview Process*** Application (resume \+ short questions \+ 15\-20 min async video interview)
* Review and response within 24\-48 hours
* Live interview with CTO and CEO (60\-90 minutes)
* Paid trial project
* Contract start, leading to full\-time offer

**What We're NOT Looking For*** AI experience \= Copilot autocomplete
* Need detailed specs before starting
* No e\-commerce background
* Want to manage people, not write code
* Uncomfortable with ""figure it out""

**Comp**  

Months 1\-3 (contract): $75/hr Month 4\+ (FTE): $150K base \+ up to 100% performance bonus \+ benefits  

Equity path is real. We're building AI automation tools internally. They work. Other e\-commerce companies want them. Right person becomes equity partner in that venture. Not a recruiting line \- actual conversation for serious candidates.

* Day 2: Response (yes/no, we don't ghost)
* Day 3: Interview with CTO \+ CEO

Reports to: COO \| Works alongside Fractional CFO

First, before you read on. Does this describe you?

* You like clean books the way some people like clean kitchens
* You notice when something doesn’t tie out before anyone else does
* You don’t wait to be told what to do, you just handle it
* You are tech\-comfortable and not intimidated by multiple systems
* You prefer progress and clarity over perfection paralysis
* You like owning your domain but being part of a strong, cohesive team
* You naturally see process failures before they become expensive problems

If this resonates with you, keep reading.  
You might be exactly who we’re looking for.

Who We Are

Good Company is a rapidly growing, innovative third\-party logistics (3PL) provider specializing in e\-commerce fulfillment.

We are not a slow, corporate environment.  
We are operational, fast\-moving, and deeply committed to clarity, accountability, and doing things the right way.

Our culture is:

* High trust
* High ownership
* Low bureaucracy
* No nonsense
* No office formalities

We value people who speak up, think critically, and take real ownership of their work.  
If you like having a voice at the table and being trusted to run your lane, you’ll fit in well here.

The Role (What This Actually Is)

This is the **financial execution engine** of the company.

You will own the day\-to\-day accounting operations that keep our books clean, reconciled, and decision\-ready at all times.

Not theoretical accounting.  
Not endless research.  
Not hiding behind process.

Execution. Clarity. Ownership.

Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It)

* Own our QuickBooks Online environment and keep it clean, current, and accurate
* Process AP invoices and manage the AP inbox (no backlog chaos)
* Reconcile bank accounts and credit cards weekly
* Match and track AR and client invoices
* Record journal entries and maintain ledger integrity
* Support monthly close through reconciliations and tie\-outs
* Track payroll recordings and operational cost allocations
* Flag inconsistencies, discrepancies, and risks early
* Help maintain financial hygiene in a fast\-growing operational business

You are the person making sure the financial engine never falls behind.

What Our Environment Looks Like (Real Numbers)

* \~30 AP invoices per week
* \~120 bank transactions per week
* \~20–25 client invoices per week
* High transaction, real\-world operational data
* Slack\-based communication
* Multiple systems (QuickBooks, Google Sheets, internal tools)

If you need a slow, perfectly predictable workflow, this is not your environment.  
If you thrive in organized complexity, you’ll love it here.

Systems You’ll Use Daily

* QuickBooks Online (heavily)
* Google Sheets / Excel
* Slack (primary communication)
* Google Workspace
* Rippling
* Cloud\-based documents and operational data systems

You should be comfortable navigating systems independently without handholding.

Let’s Be Clear About the Level of This Role

This is **not a clerical role.**  
And it is **not a purely strategic finance role** either.

It sits in the middle.

You will:

* Own the books
* Maintain financial clarity
* Keep systems clean and current
* Execute the daily accounting engine

Yes, that includes invoice entry, reconciliations, and transaction work.  
But the expectation is ownership, judgment, and process awareness — not mindless task processing.

If you are overqualified and only want to do high\-level strategy work, this role will feel too hands\-on.  
If you are looking for repetitive clerk work with narrow scope, this role will feel too autonomous.

What Success Looks Like in 90 Days

* Books are fully reconciled and current
* AP and AR are organized and predictable
* Minimal backlog, high clarity
* Clean financial visibility for leadership at all times
* Issues flagged early, not discovered late

Who You Are (Must Be True)

* 3\+ years of hands\-on bookkeeping or staff accounting experience
* Strong QuickBooks Online user (daily operator, not beginner)
* Detail\-oriented **and** action\-oriented
* Highly reliable and responsive
* Tech\-comfortable and systems\-minded
* Able to work autonomously and manage your own to\-do list
* Comfortable working with remote employees and relying on communication systems
* Desire to be the primary accounting operator in a growing company

Strong Bonus Points (But Not Required)

* Experience in logistics, eCommerce, or operational businesses
* Experience managing high\-volume transaction environments
* Experience cleaning up messy books or improving processes

Personality Fit (Very Important)You will thrive here if:

* You like ownership more than micromanagement
* You are calm, organized, and dependable
* You communicate clearly and proactively
* You enjoy improving processes, not just following them
* You take pride in clean, accurate execution

You will NOT enjoy this role if:

* You need rigid structure and perfectly predictable workflows
* You prefer to know with 100% certainty before taking action
* You are uncomfortable with your work being visible and transparent
* You require constant in\-person communication instead of async updates
* You prefer highly repetitive, single\-task clerk\-style work
* You struggle working in a diverse, fast\-paced team environment
* You resist evolving systems and improving processes

A Final Note

We don’t care about titles or ego.  
We care about reliability, clarity, and someone who takes ownership of keeping the financial engine clean and decision\-ready.

If you are the kind of person who sees where a process is going to break before it actually breaks,  
you will likely love this role.

The Director of Accounting is responsible for the strategic leadership, performance, and scalability of the Accounting function across the organization. This role provides oversight to Accounting Managers and Team Leads, ensures consistent delivery of high\-quality client work, strengthens systems and processes, and develops accounting leaders to operate independently and confidently.

This is a **people, process, and performance leadership role**—not a hands\-on bookkeeping or client\-service role. The Director of Accounting owns outcomes, standards, and team effectiveness, partnering closely with the COO to support growth, profitability, and operational excellence.

**Core Responsibilities**

**1\. Accounting Function Leadership**

* Own the overall performance and health of the Accounting department
* Set and maintain accounting standards, quality controls, and delivery expectations
* Ensure consistent execution across teams, clients, and service tiers
* Act as the escalation point for complex accounting, people, or client\-risk issues that exceed Manager authority, escalating only strategic, legal, or reputational matters to the COO.

* Clarify roles, responsibilities, and decision rights across the department
* Build leadership capability within the accounting team (delegation, accountability, communication)

**3\. Operational Excellence \& Scalability**

* Design, implement, and enforce workflows, SOPs, and capacity models that enable predictable delivery and scalable growth
* Ensure consistent onboarding, training, and ramp\-up of new accounting team members
* Identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and quality risks, and lead corrective action
* Partner with Operations to ensure workload balance and predictable delivery

**4\. Client \& Service Oversight**

* Ensure client work meets quality, timeliness, and service standards
* Support Account Managers and leaders in managing complex or at\-risk clients
* Provide guidance on scope alignment, service complexity, and escalation decisions
* Maintain strong collaboration between Accounting, Payroll, Advisory, and Onboarding teams

**5\. Metrics, Reporting \& Accountability**

* Own department\-level KPIs (quality, timeliness, utilization, capacity, client health)
* Translate department\-level KPIs into actionable insights and recommendations for the COO, informing staffing, pricing, and structural decisions
* Use data to inform staffing decisions, process improvements, and team development
* Establish clear definitions of “done” and success for accounting deliverables

**6\. Cross\-Functional Partnership**

* Partner closely with the COO on strategy, capacity planning, and org design
* Collaborate with Sales, Onboarding, Payroll, and Advisory to ensure smooth handoffs
* Contribute to leadership discussions around growth, structure, and future services

**Required Qualifications**

* 8–12\+ years of progressive accounting experience
* Prior experience leading accounting teams or managers
* Strong understanding of full\-cycle accounting and service\-based environments
* Proven ability to lead through others, not through personal execution
* Comfortable operating in a growing, evolving organization
* Strong judgment, communication skills, and leadership presence

**Preferred**

* Experience in accounting firms, outsourced accounting, or fractional services
* Experience supporting SMB or franchise clients
* Prior exposure to scaling teams or services during growth phases

**Success in This Role Looks Like**

* Accounting teams operate independently with clarity and confidence
* Quality, consistency, and timeliness improve across all clients
* Team productivity and process efficiency increase year\-over\-year through effective workflow design and resource management.
* Leadership transitions occur smoothly with minimal disruption because roles, expectations, and successors are clearly defined.
* Managers and Team Leads grow into stronger leaders
* COO is freed from day\-to\-day accounting oversight
* The department is scalable, predictable, and well\-structured for future growth

* **Flexible Time:** Can do full\-time, part\-time, side\-gig (off\-hours), or fractional (contract).
* **Flexible Commitment:** Can do short\-term, long\-term, or intermittent.


**Why so flexible?** We're racing to launch in 90 days. Feel free to jump in, help us ship, then bounce \>\> or stick around. A successful launch translates into lots of permanent jobs for those that want them. We're also interested in long\-term ""side gig"" relationships — in our experience, a few expert hours often beat full\-time learning\-curve hours.


### **About The Role**


You're looking for investors. Work your network. Reach out, book calls, ask for referrals. The trick: ask for introductions, not money. Those who are interested will raise their hand.


**No IR experience required.** We need fresh networks. Accredited investors \= $200k\+ income or $1M\+ net worth; doctors, execs, professionals. You know several.


**Two ways to participate:** (a) Generate leads and hand off to our closers, or (b) Generate and close yourself — a great way to learn from a team that's done it before. Scripts and support provided. You generate activity; we don't feed leads.


### **About Us**


We're a credible, **funded**, remote\-first startup led by a serial \[technical] founder, and backed by a 20\-person team. The product is live in private alpha.


**Why funded and still raising?** We've raised seed capital. Enough to know the process and pitch works. Now we're raising to scale — ship the product, build the team, and execute. That's why we're building our investor relations team.

### **Compensation**

### **What Success Looks Like in 30 Days**


* You've reached out to your network — emails, DMs, calls — asking for investor referrals
* You've booked calls with qualified prospects or secured warm introductions
* You've asked for referrals on every conversation — no exceptions
* You've established a sustainable rhythm of network outreach
* If you're closing: you've flipped qualified leads through the process


### **What You'll Do**


* **Work your network** — LinkedIn, email, phone. Reach out to people you know and ask for referrals to accredited investors
* **Book calls** — schedule qualified prospects for conversations with our team (or with you, if you're closing)
* **Ask for referrals** — every conversation ends with a request for introductions
* **Qualify leads** — confirm accredited investor status and interest level
* **Close (optional)** — if you want to work end\-to\-end, we provide scripts and support for both sourcing and closing


### **What We Provide**


* **Starter scripts** for both sourcing (referral asks, outreach) and closing (pitch, follow\-up)
* **Access to people who have done it** — learn from those already running this playbook
* CRM access, systems, and support


### **What We're Looking For**


* **Existing professional network** that includes or can reach US Accredited Investors (executives, doctors, HNW professionals, etc.)
* **Comfortable asking for referrals** — you don't shy away from ""who do you know who might be interested?""
* **Self\-starter** — you generate your own activity from relationships, not from lists we provide
* **Strong communicator** — clear, professional, persuasive
* **No IR experience required** — we're looking for people who can work their network, not necessarily people who have raised capital before

Malloy Industries is building our **Fractional Executive Roster**. This posting is for experienced engineering leaders who want to be considered for **future fractional client engagements** (typically **10–20 hours/week**). If you’re looking for a W\-2, full\-time internal role, this won’t be the right fit.

**About Malloy Industries**  
Malloy Industries connects B2B CEOs (typically $1M–$50M revenue, 10–100 employees) with vetted fractional executives who help bring structure to chaos. We’re known for being relentlessly generous, vulnerably trustworthy, enthusiastically fun, independently productive, and flexibly learning—and we take client outcomes seriously.

We’re expanding our Fractional Executive Network and are looking for experienced Fractional COOs / Directors of Operations to join our roster for potential client collaborations.

**Important: This is NOT a full\-time job**

As a roster member, you may be matched with US\-based clients who need fractional support—often **5–20 hours/week,** depending on engagement needs.

While we can’t guarantee a specific volume of client work, members join because we invest in their success with meaningful support and a strong matching process.

**Compensation:** Compensation varies by client engagement and scope and will be discussed during the matching process.

**What You’ll Do (Founding Engineer / Fractional Technical Lead)**

* Establish engineering best practices: code quality, testing approach, CI/CD basics, documentation
* Lead technical execution across contractors/junior engineers (lightweight leadership, strong accountability)
* Own technical discovery: “what should we build, what should we not build, and why”
* Improve reliability and performance as the product scales (monitoring, incident prevention, cost awareness)

**Who This Is For (and who it’s not):** This is a fit if you’ve been responsible for building real software products and can lead delivery—not just advise. **This is NOT an IT support / helpdesk / MSP role.** We’re looking for **product/software engineering** talent (the people who build the product).

**Requirements**  
***Must\-haves***

* 8\+ years experience in software engineering (or equivalent depth of experience)
* Experience in B2B SaaS or software product environments (preferred), or software\-first teams in other industries
* Proven ability to ship production software and own outcomes end\-to\-end
* Strong communication skills (you can explain tradeoffs to non\-technical leaders clearly)
* Comfortable working independently in a fractional/consulting\-style environment
* US\-based; able to work remotely with US clients

***Strongly preferred***

* Prior “founding engineer” / early\-stage build experience (0→1, MVP→v1\)
* Technical leadership experience (leading small teams, contractors, or setting standards/process)
* Experience with modern web stacks (framework/tooling varies by client—adaptability matters)

**Benefits of Joining the Malloy Industries Network**

* **Qualified lead pipeline** delivering pre\-vetted, growth\-stage companies ready to collaborate
* **Seamless back\-office support** that handles all contracts, invoicing, and payment processing
* **Active success partnership** featuring weekly check\-ins to support you and monthly client reviews to protect your work

* **Seasonal Executive Roundtables \& Events:** Exclusive sessions designed for fractional executives to collaborate, share learnings, and explore synergies
* **Member Spotlight Features:** Visibility through our platform to build authority and attract ideal clients

**How to Apply (required)**  
Applications are only accepted through our apply page and roundtable process.
