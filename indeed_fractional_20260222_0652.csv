SOU Land Acknowledgement
  
We want to take this moment to acknowledge that Southern Oregon University is located within the ancestral homelands of the Shasta, Takelma, and Latgawa peoples who lived here since time immemorial. These Tribes were displaced during rapid Euro\-American colonization, the Gold Rush, and armed conflict between 1851 and 1856\. In the 1850s, the discovery of gold and settlement brought thousands of Euro\-Americans to their lands, leading to warfare, epidemics, starvation, and villages being burned. In 1853 the first of several treaties were signed, confederating these Tribes and others together \- who would then be referred to as the Rogue River Tribe. These treaties ceded most of their homelands to the United States, and in return, they were guaranteed a permanent homeland reserved for them. At the end of the Rogue River Wars in 1856, these Tribes and many other Tribes from western Oregon were removed to the Siletz Reservation and the Grand Ronde Reservation. Today, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Community of Oregon ( www.grandronde.org ) and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians ( www.ctsi.nsn.us ) are living descendants of the Takelma, Shasta, and Latgawa peoples of this area. We encourage YOU to learn about the land you reside on and to join us in advocating for the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous people.

GXA is a growing IT services and cybersecurity company based in Richardson, Texas. We help Texas\-based small and mid\-sized businesses operate securely, efficiently, and with confidence through strategic IT leadership and proactive support.
 

We’re a collaborative, growth\-focused team that values ownership, reliability, follow\-through, and continuous improvement. We specialize in AI\-powered IT solutions, cybersecurity, and strategic technology consulting for organizations typically ranging from 30 to 250 employees across verticals like education, commercial real estate, manufacturing, and nonprofits.


**Location:** Richardson, TX (Onsite)  

**Schedule:** Monday–Friday, standard business hours (with occasional event\-based hours)

**About This Role**


GXA is building a world\-class marketing function, and we need a hands\-on coordinator to bring our events, content, and community engagement programs to life.


This is a newly created, execution\-focused role responsible for the logistics and production behind:

* Monthly in\-person events (executive lunches, happy hours, industry panels, client events)
* Webinars (including “simulated live” processes)
* Podcast and video content program (guest scheduling, recording logistics, publishing cadence support)


The goal is to remove the leadership team from operational coordination so they can focus on being present and delivering great content. You’ll work closely with GXA’s leadership, fractional CMO (strategy/content direction) and internal marketing operations lead (HubSpot, dashboards, digital campaigns) to keep programs moving smoothly and consistently.


This role is ideal for someone early\-to\-mid career who thrives on planning, coordination, and execution—and wants to grow in campaign delivery and B2B demand generation

* Own end\-to\-end logistics for GXA’s podcast/video program: guest recruitment support, scheduling, outline prep coordination, recording day logistics, and post\-production handoff
* Ensure presenters and guests are prepared with talking points, scripts, and equipment readiness (mic, webcam, lighting)
* Coordinate batch recording days to maximize efficiency
* Source and book recording studios or offsite venues when needed
* Manage webinar logistics: pre\-recording coordination, day\-of operations, and Q\&A support staffing/briefing
* Track content production pipeline to maintain a consistent publishing cadence




**3\) Marketing Operations \& Campaign Support (20–25%)**


* Support email marketing campaigns, contact list management, outreach, and basic campaign coordination
* Assist with digital marketing initiatives tied to events, lead generation, and follow\-up
* Help coordinate production of marketing materials and sales collateral
* Ensure brand consistency across marketing assets and activities
* Track campaign and content performance metrics; assist with reporting and dashboards




**4\) Community Engagement \& Outreach Support (10–15%)**


* Identify and pursue speaking, panel, and sponsorship opportunities for GXA leadership in DFW
* Coordinate co\-marketing activities with strategic partners (e.g., cyber insurance brokers, CPA firms, HR tech firms)
* Support LinkedIn/community engagement programs through partner coordination and cross\-promotion
* Build and maintain relationships with venues, guests, vendors, and industry contacts

**Requirements**


**Must Have**

* 2\+ years of experience in marketing coordination, event coordination, marketing operations, communications, production coordination, or related fields
* Experience planning and executing in\-person business events
* Strong organizational skills with ability to manage multiple deadlines at once
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
* Comfortable with technology and learning tools quickly (HubSpot, Asana, Zoom, Teams, LinkedIn, etc.)
* Based in the DFW area and able to be onsite regularly (office \+ events)
* Self\-starter who can own a process end\-to\-end without needing constant direction

**Preferred**

* Experience coordinating podcast or video production logistics (guest booking, studio coordination, equipment checklists, post\-production workflow)
* Familiarity with HubSpot (CRM, workflows, forms, event registration) or similar platforms
* B2B and/or technology industry marketing experience
* Comfortable appearing on camera or moderating a conversation when needed
* Experience sourcing sponsorships or speaking opportunities at conferences/events

**Candidates with backgrounds in corporate marketing, hospitality, nonprofit event coordination, executive admin \+ marketing exposure, or production management are encouraged to apply.**

**What Success Looks Like**

**First 30–90 Days**

* Planned and executed at least one in\-person event (15\+ attendees) that supports pipeline creation
* Podcast/video recording workflow is operating smoothly with guests booked 4–6 weeks out
* Webinar logistics process documented and repeatable
* Leadership team spends minimal\-to\-zero time on logistics (shows up, delivers, leaves)
* Identified 3–5 speaking/sponsorship opportunities for the next quarter with recommendations ready for review

**By Month Six**

* Monthly events run consistently with measurable ROI reporting
* Webinar program runs independently
* Content publishing cadence is reliable and predictable
* GXA has presence at 2–3 external DFW events per quarter
* Event\-sourced and content\-influenced leads are being tracked and reported clearly

===============



NewLimit is seeking a Director of Operations to support our scientific teams and build a strong G\&A function. This is a high\-impact role focused on increasing our effectiveness, efficiency, and execution velocity.

**Requirements**

* Operating experience in a biotech, technology, or manufacturing company (e.g. Technical Operations, Product Management, Process/Industrial Engineering, Finance, Business Development, management consulting).
* Degree in a technical field (natural sciences, computer science, engineering) strongly preferred.

If you are an established leadership consultant, executive coach, or senior executive navigating a professional transition, you are likely not looking for another traditional role. You already bring credibility, influence, and professional judgment shaped by real responsibility.

This is an independent Strategic Partnership, not employment. It is designed for experienced professionals who are prepared to deploy a proven leadership system rather than spend months, or years, building curriculum, infrastructure, and delivery models from scratch.

Whether you have recently exited a corporate role, are entering a fractional advisory phase, or are seeking to monetize decades of leadership experience, the challenge is the same: converting expertise into scalable, repeatable impact without reinventing everything yourself.

**The Opportunity**

Relationship Media, LLC is inviting a limited number of experienced professionals to deploy a field\-tested leadership system built around the *Be Like Tony \& Don’t Be Like Chad* framework.

Developed by a former S.W.A.T. commander with more than 20 years of real\-world leadership experience, the system addresses a growing breakdown in trust, communication, and accountability inside modern organizations.

This is not theoretical leadership training. It is a practical, example\-driven methodology designed to work across industries, organizational cultures, and leadership environments.

**The Commitment (Integration \& Execution)**

We are not seeking employees. We are building a small, aligned group of Strategic Partners who are prepared to take ownership of their next chapter. This opportunity requires personal initiative, discipline, and follow\-through.

**What Is Provided**

* A complete, ready\-to\-deploy leadership system.
* A plug\-and\-play LMS and delivery infrastructure.
* Participant materials and administrative backend.
* Professional positioning and marketing assets.
* Dedicated one\-on\-one coaching provided after successful completion of the required system training to ensure proper positioning and confident deployment.

**What You Control**

* Your pace.
* Your schedule.
* Your professional relationships.
* Your results.

**Training**

* There are no mandatory training schedules or deadlines.
* Progress is self\-paced and driven by your initiative and ability to activate professional relationships.
* Full access to the leadership system, LMS, and Strategic Partner resources is provided immediately to support training and integration.
* Dedicated one\-on\-one coaching is made available after successful completion of the required system training to ensure proper positioning and responsible deployment of the framework.

**Income Model**

Compensation is performance\-based and tied directly to your ability to deploy the system within your existing relationships. Revenue is generated through the use and sale of the leadership training system.

Strategic Partners may leverage the established Relationship Media, LLC brand or inquire about advanced delivery options once aligned and established.

**This Is a Strong Fit If You Are:**

* A retired, semi\-retired, or recently displaced executive with meaningful professional relationships.
* An experienced consultant or coach seeking a proven, example\-driven system.
* A professional who understands that relationships, not funnels, drives opportunity.
* Someone prepared to invest time, discipline, and focused effort into building momentum.

**Important Note**

This is not a salaried role, a W\-2 position, or an opportunity where leads are provided. Strategic Partners are responsible for generating opportunities through their own professional relationships and reputation.

**Next Step**

To ensure alignment, all interested candidates must complete a brief Strategic Partner Questionnaire. This selective process is designed to confirm readiness, expectations, and fit before a private evaluation conversation is scheduled.

* Present financial reports in client meetings and answer strategic questions
* Identify financial risks and growth opportunities
* Bridge tactical financial execution with broader CFO\-level strategy
* Support implementation of financial systems and infrastructure improvements

**Internal Team Collaboration \& Firm Growth**

* Partner closely with the Founder and internal team members to ensure consistent service quality
* Provide oversight, feedback, coaching \& development to bookkeepers and operational financial staff.
* Help refine internal workflows, reporting templates, and financial standards
* Contribute to onboarding new clients and shaping service delivery models
* Identify opportunities to expand client engagements or improve service offerings
* Support the development of scalable systems as Balanced Ops grows

*Atlanta, GA \-* ***onsite****.*

***Overview***

The Director of Client Experience and Service Delivery is accountable for delivering an extraordinary client experience and for building durable, trusted business relationships across our MSP/MSSP client base. This leader ensures clients consistently experience us as highly responsive, easy to work with, and aligned to their evolving business needs. This is an entrepreneurial role and a key evolution in how we operate as an MSP/MSSP. We are building a more intentional, relationship\-centered, advisory\-integrated service delivery model—and this Director will build the playbook. While day\-to\-day support center metrics and operational execution are owned by the Support Center Manager, this Director owns the end\-to\-end client experience: relationship health, expectation management, escalation leadership, and value realization. The Director is a peer to the Director of IT Operations and Engineering and partners closely to ensure delivery teams, project teams, and third\-party providers collectively produce a cohesive, high\-trust client experience.

**Job Requirements \& Responsibilities**

· Client Experience Leadership: Define and implement standards, playbooks, and governance for proactive, high\-trust client engagement.

· Executive Relationship Management: Build strong Director/C\-level relationships, align services to evolving business needs, and lead escalations with professionalism.

· Value Demonstration: Translate technical outcomes into business impact, ensuring clients understand the value of MSP/MSSP services.

· Advisory Integration: Orchestrate fractional advisory services into the client journey, positioning them as a differentiator.

· Team Leadership: Inspire and coach account management and support leaders to deliver consistent, client\-focused outcomes.

***Key Measures of Success***

· Extraordinary Client Experience: Clients consistently describe interactions as responsive, proactive, and trusted, with clear communication and effective escalation handling.

· Executive Relationship Strength: Deepened engagement at the Director/C\-level through regular governance, alignment to business goals, and visible advisory value.

· Value Demonstration: Clients clearly understand and acknowledge the business impact of MSP/MSSP services—improved reliability, reduced risk, and strategic enablement.

· Operational Integration \& Team Performance: Seamless coordination across support, account management, advisory, and delivery teams, resulting in fewer escalations and strong client satisfaction.

**Preferred Experience \& Qualifications**

· 8\+ years in the service business, IT/MSP/MSSP, or client\-facing technology leadership roles.

· Proven success in client experience, account management, and executive relationship building.

· Strong communication and escalation management skills; ability to create structure and standards at scale.

· Familiarity with ITIL and service management best practices preferred.

**Essential Attributes**

* Strong communication and leadership skills with a focus on precision and professionalism.
* High emotional intelligence and the ability to coach and mentor on building and maintaining professional relationships

**Why This Role Matters**  
This role defines how we deliver extraordinary client experiences at scale—deepening relationships, demonstrating value, and ensuring seamless service delivery across all touchpoints.

(Salary range is dependant upon related experience, education, skill level.) This role also offers a yearly performance bonus.
