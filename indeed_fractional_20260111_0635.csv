You will work directly with the co\-founders to design and evolve our technical foundation, product roadmap, and long\-term systems strategy. This role blends hands\-on building with strategic leadership.

* Evaluate and implement tools, frameworks, and integrations as the platform evolves.
* Support experimentation, iteration, and user feedback loops.
* Prepare the platform for future scale, partnerships, and funding readiness.

* Clear communication with non\-technical stakeholders
* Comfort with ambiguity and early\-stage problem solving
* Ethical and privacy\-conscious development
* Leadership through collaboration, not hierarchy

* Continuous learning and adaptability

**Education and Experience** We care more about how you think and build than where you studied.

Ideal experience includes:

* Experience building or leading technical development for a startup or early\-stage product.
* Comfort owning architecture decisions end\-to\-end.
* Experience working on SaaS platforms, data\-driven products, or education\-related tools is a plus.
* Familiarity with user\-centered design and iterative development.
* Experience collaborating with non\-technical founders or cross\-functional teams.
* A track record of shipping meaningful products, not just prototypes.

If you’re self\-taught, career\-switching, or have a nontraditional background, we want to hear from you.

**Physical Requirements** This is a remote\-first role. Occasional travel may be optional for team sessions, school visits, or partner meetings as the company grows.

**Commitment to Diversity** Ecopreneur is committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and values\-driven team. We believe meaningful innovation comes from diverse lived experiences and perspectives. We encourage candidates of all backgrounds, identities, and paths to apply.

About Purrgato Funworks

Purrgato Funworks is an early\-stage, design\-forward studio building premium pet enrichment products. Our flagship product, The Whisker™, is a supervised interactive cat enrichment system designed around behavioral science, craftsmanship, and intentional play.

We are not a mass\-market pet toy company. We are building a thoughtful, durable brand with a long\-term product ecosystem and a deliberate growth cadence.

This role exists to help us do that well — not fast at the expense of integrity.

The Role

We are seeking a Fractional COO / Operations \& Strategy Partner to help translate a strong product vision into sustainable execution.

This is not a generic operations role and not a marketing position. It is a systems\-level role for someone who can hold the full business context — operations, financial mechanics, and execution sequencing — so the founder can remain focused on product philosophy, brand, and strategic decisions.

This role will begin fractional and may evolve over time.

What You’ll Be Responsible For

Operations \& Execution

* Coordinate with vendors and manufacturers
* Manage production timelines, lead times, and dependencies
* Support inventory and fulfillment planning
* Build and maintain lightweight operational systems and documentation

Financial Mechanics (Not Strategy)

* Track cash flow and burn
* Maintain unit economics and margin models
* Support scenario planning and runway forecasting
* Flag risks early and clearly

Context Holding \& Translation

* Hold the full business picture across product, ops, and finance
* Surface decisions and tradeoffs — not noise
* Help sequence growth deliberately rather than prematurely
* Act as a calm, grounded partner in execution

What You Will

Not

Own

* Product philosophy or creative direction
* Brand voice or storytelling
* Final pricing authority
* Investor narrative or fundraising leadership

You advise. The founder decides.

Who This Role Is For

You may be a strong fit if you:

* Have experience in physical consumer goods, not just software
* Understand small\-batch or premium manufacturing
* Are comfortable operating without heavy bureaucracy
* Can hold ambiguity without forcing premature answers
* Value margin, pacing, and sustainability over hype
* Prefer building something durable to chasing rapid scale

Who This Role Is

Not

For

This role is not a fit if you are looking to:

* “Growth hack” or push mass\-market strategies early
* Strip cost or meaning at the expense of product integrity
* Apply startup playbooks without context
* Optimize for speed alone

Compensation

* Fractional commitment (10–20 hrs/week initially)
* Combination of:

\*

* modest cash compensation
* advisory equity

\*

* Scope and compensation may evolve with the business

How to Apply

Please apply with:

* A resume or LinkedIn profile
* A brief note (no cover letter required) answering:How do you decide when not to scale something that appears to be working?

Thoughtful answers matter more than credentials.

---------------------


**Business Development \& Strategic Partnerships Lead (Fractional)**



Black Fox Global is seeking a **senior, fractional Business Development \& Strategic Partnerships Lead** to advance sustainable, values\-aligned revenue growth without compromising delivery quality, culture, or system health.



This role is intentionally structured as a **90–120 day pilot** to test whether focused, senior\-level business development capacity can convert strong inbound interest, long\-standing relationships, and market credibility into contracted, values\-aligned engagements. The role is additive to existing leadership\-led business development efforts and is evaluated on the quality and progression of owned opportunities, not sole responsibility for firm\-wide revenue outcomes.



The role prioritizes judgment over volume. In practice, this means disciplined advancement of a limited number of well\-aligned opportunities, alongside thoughtful stewardship of a broader pipeline. Success is demonstrated through movement toward decision and commitment, strength of relationships advanced, and tangible revenue momentum.



Black Fox Global’s core client segment includes NGOs with approximately **$1M–$10M in annual revenue**, organizations large enough to benefit meaningfully from systems, strategy, and relationship\-building, and at a stage where the right support materially changes outcomes.



The ideal candidate brings **senior judgment, credibility, and direct outcomes responsibility** in trust\-based environments. They operate comfortably peer\-to\-peer with founders, executives, and funders; guide conversations toward committed engagements with integrity; and maintain discipline around scope and prioritization.



Compensation includes a **monthly retainer ($5,000–$6,000\)** and a **performance\-based bonus (3–7%)** tied to contracted revenue the individual materially advances. Bonus eligibility is clearly defined to reward meaningful contribution, including co\-selling with leadership, with protections for fairness and continuity.



Beyond revenue outcomes, this initial engagement serves as a learning period. Where there is demonstrated fit and mutual interest, insights from this phase may inform longer\-term leadership continuity or succession considerations — optional, emergent, and never assumed.


**Full Description**


**Black Fox Global \| Business Development/Strategic Partnerships Lead \| Fractional \& Remote**



15 hours/week \| Fractional, remote role with an initial 90–120 day engagement designed to assess fit and inform potential next phases. Conference participation may be included.


**About Black Fox Global (BFG)**



Black Fox Global is a global fundraising firm that has partnered with NGOs, foundations, and mission\-driven organizations around the world for more than 12 years.



We support leaders carrying real responsibility—helping them mobilize resources, build durable funder relationships, and scale impact without compromising integrity, exhausting their teams, or relying on transactional fundraising tactics.


**Our work is known for:**


* Outcome\-driven partnerships that build durable, independent capacity for NGOs across regions and issue areas.
* Longstanding, trusted relationships across the funding and NGO ecosystem.
* Clear thinking, open knowledge\-sharing, and consistently strong results.

As the sector evolves, we are also investing in AI\-enabled tools and intelligent systems to strengthen fundraising expertise access, strategy, decision\-making, and long\-term sustainability.


**Why This Role Exists**



This new role exists to test whether focused, senior\-level business development capacity can unlock sustainable revenue without compromising delivery quality or culture. Black Fox Global benefits from consistent inbound interest, long\-standing relationships ready for reactivation, and a strong but underleveraged trusted presence across the impact ecosystem, all of which warrant intentional, senior\-level cultivation and follow\-through.



Beyond revenue outcomes, this initial engagement is designed to inform longer\-term leadership and founder succession planning, should there be mutual interest and demonstrated fit. Succession exploration is optional, emergent, and not implied as an expectation.


**Initial Engagement Focus (First 90–120 Days)**



The initial phase is designed to assess alignment, market signal, and tangible revenue momentum. While Black Fox Global does not pursue misaligned or pressured closing, business generation is a core expectation during this period.



Success is demonstrated by the ability to move qualified opportunities meaningfully forward, from opening doors, through trust\-based conversations, to committed, values\-aligned engagements, in ways that strengthen both revenue and reputation.



Recognizing that trust\-based NGO decision cycles vary, evaluation considers not only revenue outcomes, but also the progression and quality of owned opportunities, including movement toward decision, strength of relationships advanced, and alignment with delivery capacity.


**Areas of Responsibility \| Priority Outcomes**



This role is designed to be additive and complementary to existing business development efforts led by Black Fox Global leadership. While the Business Development \& Strategic Partnerships Lead will own and advance a defined subset of priority opportunities, overall firm revenue generation is a shared responsibility across leadership.



Success in this role is assessed based on the quality and progression of created and owned opportunities, contribution to overall pipeline health, and alignment with delivery capacity. Responsibilities include:


* Re\-activate dormant relationships and advance them toward contracted engagement, with a primary focus on NGOs operating within Black Fox Global’s core growth segment: Organizations with approximately $1M–$10M in annual revenue, who are:
* + Established enough to benefit meaningfully from systems, strategy, and relationship\-building
	+ Still at a stage where the right support materially changes outcomes
	+ Led by ambitious, mission\-driven leaders seeking greater clarity, confidence, and funder strategy
	+ Ready to translate advisory and fundraising support into real, sustainable revenue growth
* Initiate and cultivate new, high\-quality conversations and introductions, leveraging trusted networks and targeted sector engagement to convert aligned interest into qualified opportunities.
* Assess funder appetite and broader sector dynamics related to capacity\-building, advisory, and fundraising support for organizations in this stage of growth.
* Advance select warm or well\-aligned opportunities through proposal, decision, and contracted engagement.
* Leverage the Black Fox Global ecosystem, reputation, and relationships to build a strong pipeline of NGO partners for whom this work is both timely and transformative.

In practice, this role prioritizes disciplined advancement of a select number of well\-aligned opportunities. Within the first 60 \- 90 days, the expectation is focused engagement across approximately 8 \- 10 priority opportunities that are actively moving toward decision or already contracted, alongside lighter stewardship of a broader set of warm and longer\-term relationships within the Black Fox Global / sector ecosystem.



Success in this role depends on sound judgment about where to concentrate effort, how to pace trust\-based conversations, and when to advance, pause, or decline opportunities in service of sustainable growth and delivery quality.



Longer\-term stewardship, expanded scope, and deeper revenue ownership may be explored if this initial phase demonstrates both fit and results. More in the ‘Growth \& Continuity’ section.


**Market Presence \& Signal**



Every external interaction this person has serves as a quiet signal of who we are, how we lead, and what we stand for.


* Represent BFG with professionalism, composure, and gravitas.
* Communicate our ethos of generosity and excellence through judgment, restraint, and clarity.

**Technology\-Enabled Futures \& AI Curiosity**



AI fluency is not required for initial success in this role. However, curiosity about technology\-enabled futures will become increasingly relevant as Black Fox Global evolves. We are actively exploring the development of an AI\-enabled fundraising and strategy agent grounded in Black Fox Global’s methodology, ethics/ethos, and relational intelligence. Candidates who are excited by innovative ways to serve at scale will be especially well\-aligned.


**Collaboration with Founder \& Operations**


* Work closely with the Founder and operational leadership in a spirit of partnership and shared accountability.
* Collaborate closely with Operations to ensure tight alignment from business development through delivery, including clear handoffs, shared expectations, and consistent client experience.
* Advance opportunities with a clear understanding of delivery capacity, system health, and operational constraints, ensuring what we promise externally can be delivered with excellence.
* Surface insights early to support sustainable planning, execution, and client success.

**Ideal Candidate**



This role is designed for someone who brings senior judgment, real closing responsibility, and calm authority to business development in trust\-based environments.


***You are likely:***


* A senior sales, partnerships, or fundraising leader who has held direct responsibility for advancing and closing contracted engagements.
* Someone who has operated in high\-stakes executive contexts within the impact, philanthropic, or NGO ecosystem, and is now seeking a portfolio\-style role that prioritizes meaning, discernment, and sustainability.
* Deeply experienced in trust\-based, relational environments, where progress is built through credibility, timing, and judgment rather than transactional pressure.
* Comfortable engaging NGO executives, funders, and institutional partners globally, and guiding conversations toward clear, values\-aligned commitments.
* A recognized and respected presence within leading global convenings and networks shaping the social impact sector.
* Grounded in mission\-driven work and “sacred sales” or fundraising practices, with curiosity about how technology and AI\-enabled systems may responsibly support future impact.

***You bring:***


* A demonstrated track record of moving high\-value engagements from early trust\-building through decision, commitment, and contract.
* The ability to balance ambition with restraint, pursuing growth that strengthens systems, relationships, and reputation over time.
* A collaborative, partnership\-oriented approach that complements leadership teams.
* Strong judgment around what to pursue, and what to decline, in service of protecting team capacity and system health.

**Culture \& How We Lead**


***At Black Fox Global, leadership looks like:***


* Generosity without self\-erasure.
* Direct, respectful communication grounded in care and accountability.
* Ambition in service of mission.
* Power held responsibly.

We care deeply about trust, clarity, and system health.


**Growth \& Continuity**



For the right person, strong contribution may lead to expanded scope, elevated leadership designation, longer\-term continuity, profit participation and partner\-track exploration. Nothing is assumed or rushed; any evolution would be grounded in results, trust, and mutual fit.


**Compensation**



This role includes a monthly retainer of $5,000 \- $6,000 and meaningful performance\-based bonus structure, tied directly to revenue outcomes of closed contracts owned by the individual. Compensation is designed to be fair, transparent, and proportionate, supporting both immediate contribution and longer\-term alignment. The performance bonus structure scales from 3% to 8% based upon cumulative new revenue closed, rewarding increasing impact while preserving long\-term sustainability.

  




The intent is to:


* Reward real results, not activity
* Align incentives with sustainable, values\-led growth
* Preserve operational integrity and delivery quality
* Create shared upside when impact and revenue compound

This structure applies to the initial scope of work of this contract.


**Context \| Typical Engagement Size \& Sales Cycle**



Black Fox Global engagements vary by scope and client readiness, but typically fall within the following ranges:


* Engagement size: BFG’s service pricing generally spans approximately $10,000 to $100,000, depending upon service mix, duration, and delivery scope (e.g., advisory engagements vs. multi\-month accelerator or transformer programs).
* Quarterly number of new engagements: approximately 7–8 across the firm, generated through a combination of leadership\-led business development, inbound demand, and this role’s owned opportunities.
* Sales cycle: Active sales cycles typically range from three weeks to six months, influenced by factors such as organizational readiness, decision\-making structure, and alignment with funding timelines.

Candidates should be comfortable operating across both shorter\-cycle and longer\-cycle opportunities, exercising judgment around where to invest time based on likelihood of close, delivery readiness, and strategic alignment. This role is evaluated on owned opportunity advancement, not sole responsibility for total firm\-wide contracted engagements.


**Performance Bonus Scale**



This performance bonus structure is designed to reward material contribution to real revenue outcomes, align upside with impact, and protect Black Fox Global’s long\-term sustainability.


### **Bonus Rates (Cumulative New Revenue Contracted During the Contract Period)**


* Bonus eligibility begins after the first **$100,000** in cumulative new revenue contracted.
* **3%** applies to the next **$100,000 ($100,001–$200,000\).**
* **5%** applies to the following **$100,000 ($200,001–$300,000\).**
* **7%** applies to all cumulative revenue **above $300,000\.**

**Illustrative Examples**


**$200,000 in contracted engagements**


* $100,000 × 3% \= **$3,000**

**Total bonus: $3,000**



 **$300,000 in contracted engagements**


* $100,000 × 3% \= **$3,000**
* $100,000 × 5% \= **$5,000**

**Total bonus: $8,000**


**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**


**$400,000 in contracted engagements**


* $100,000 × 3% \= **$3,000**
* $100,000 × 5% \= **$5,000**
* $100,000 × 7% \= **$7,000**

**Total bonus: $15,000**


**Revenue Ownership \& Bonus Eligibility**



For the purposes of performance bonuses, “owned revenue” refers to contracted engagements where the individual has played a material role in advancing the opportunity from early engagement through decision and contracted engagement, whether independently or in partnership with the Founder or other team members. Ownership may include, but is not limited to:


* Origination of the opportunity
* Reactivation and advancement of an existing relationship
* Strategic positioning, stewardship, and movement of an opportunity through proposal, decision, and close
* Co\-selling alongside the Founder or other Black Fox Global leadership, with the individual serving in the lead business development role

In cases where an engagement is co\-developed, but responsibility for final contracting shifts to Black Fox Global leadership due to capacity or relationship considerations, bonus eligibility and credit will be determined based on material contribution. Where possible, alignment on ownership and credit will be discussed and agreed upon in advance.



Final determination of ownership and bonus eligibility rests with Black Fox Global and is guided by transparency, fairness, and alignment with the intent of this role.


**Bonus Timing \& Eligibility**



Performance bonuses are earned based on the cumulative contract value of engagements closed during the contract period. Bonus payments are paid pro\-rata in alignment with client payment tranches, and may extend beyond the conclusion of the contractor’s engagement, provided that:


* the engagement was closed during the contract period, and
* client payments are received by Black Fox Global.

Engagements that are surfaced and materially advanced by the contractor during the contract period, but contracted by another Black Fox Global team member after the contractor’s engagement concludes, will be eligible for 50% of the applicable performance bonus, provided that:


* the client engagement is executed within six (6\) months following the end of the contractor’s term, and
* Black Fox Global has received client payments under the applicable contract.

All bonus provisions apply only to the initial contracted engagement and does not extend to retainer extensions, or additional services contracted beyond the original scope.


**Equal Opportunity \& Inclusive Culture**



At Black Fox Global, we are committed to building a culture of belonging that provides opportunities for all qualified individuals. We believe a work environment that embraces and incorporates diverse strengths, backgrounds, and viewpoints makes us stronger and more effective in realizing our mission to advance meaningful social impact. We welcome candidates who share our commitment to equity, collaboration, and generosity, and we encourage applications from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, ages, and experiences.

We provide the solution.  
You provide the relationships.  
Together, we equip leaders to rebuild culture, performance, and trust.

* Add a scalable, recurring income stream without increasing hours.

This is a strong fit if you want to expand your offerings with a practical, high\-impact leadership system that produces measurable change and repeat business.

You may be an ideal partner if you are:

* An experienced consultant seeking a proven, credible system to expand your client impact.
* A retired or semi\-retired executive with trust\-based relationships and industry influence.
* A natural connector who understands the value of your network.
* Motivated by meaningful work, cultural transformation, and performance\-based income.

This partnership is designed for professionals who recognize that their relationships are their greatest asset.
