**Quentasia Studios**

Quentasia Studios is building a new model for premium, inclusive storytelling—one designed to be legible, auditable, and investable at institutional scale. As we prepare to scale into a multi\-slate entertainment studio, we are seeking a **Chief Financial Officer (CFO)** who is not only a rigorous financial operator, but a strategic partner capable of translating creative ambition into durable economic outcomes.

This role is for someone who understands that **financial discipline is not a constraint on creativity — it is the condition that makes creative freedom possible**.

Why This Role Matters

The CFO will be one of the most critical architects of Quentasia’s future.

This role will directly influence:

* How capital is raised, structured, and protected
* How investors experience transparency and trust
* How creative projects are financed without compromising values
* How Quentasia earns credibility with institutional allocators

This is an opportunity to help build a studio that treats finance not as a back\-office function, but as a core strategic capability.

Key ResponsibilitiesCapital Strategy \& Investor Stewardship

* Co\-lead capital raising across equity, debt, and strategic partnerships.
* Represent Quentasia in conversations with family offices, institutions, banks, and strategic capital partners.
* Design capital structures that balance risk, flexibility, and long\-term value creation.
* Partner with the CEO in articulating Quentasia’s financial narrative to investors and stakeholders.

Financial Strategy, Modeling \& Governance

* Design and maintain financial models for the studio and slate, including project cash flows, recoupment waterfalls, and return scenarios.
* Establish clear financial guardrails that enable growth while protecting downside risk.
* Build systems that allow investors to understand performance, not just projections.

Systems, Controls \& Transparency

* Build and oversee robust financial systems, controls, and reporting frameworks.
* Ensure compliance with accounting standards, internal controls, and risk management protocols.
* Partner with internal and external stakeholders to ensure financial data is accurate, timely, and decision\-useful.

Production Finance \& Structural Oversight

* Oversee project\-level financing structures, including SPVs, tax incentives, payroll, and union/guild compliance.
* Ensure production finance decisions align with both investor expectations and creative realities.
* Coordinate with production accounting teams to ensure consistency and discipline across projects.

Strategic Partnership with the CEO

* Serve as the CEO’s closest partner in evaluating trade\-offs between growth, capital deployment, and long\-term sustainability.
* Provide clear, principled counsel in moments of ambiguity or pressure.
* Help shape the long\-term operating model of the studio as it scales.

Culture, Integrity \& Financial Leadership

* Uphold Quentasia’s values in all financial dealings.
* Model integrity, clarity, and accountability in decision\-making.
* Lead with both rigor and humanity, recognizing that finance is ultimately about stewarding trust.

Ideal Candidate Profile

* Senior finance leader with experience in entertainment, media, private equity, or complex operating environments.
* Demonstrated track record in capital raising and structuring sophisticated financial transactions.
* Deep experience building financial systems, controls, and reporting infrastructure.
* Strong understanding of US GAAP, IFRS, production finance, tax incentives, and unionized workforces is highly valued.
* Comfortable operating in a lean, evolving organization while building for scale.
* High emotional intelligence, strong communication skills, and investor presence.
* A principled operator who believes finance exists to enable excellence, not restrict it.

Engagement Structure

Because Quentasia is in a pre\-funding and early scaling phase, this role will begin as:

* Advisory or fractional, transitioning to full\-time as financing milestones are achieved
* Active participation in capital strategy and leadership formation
* Advisory equity participation to reflect early belief and contribution
* Full compensation package (salary \+ equity) activated post\-funding

Candidates must be willing to sign a non\-binding **Letter of Intent (LOI)** confirming interest in being identified as part of Quentasia’s founding leadership circle.

The Opportunity

Most studios hire CFOs to manage budgets.

At Quentasia, you will help design the financial system that makes ambitious, values\-aligned storytelling sustainable at scale.

You will help build a studio where capital is disciplined, transparency is non\-negotiable, and financial leadership is a source of strength — for creators, investors, and the company alike.

Pay: $225,000\.00 \- $250,000\.00 per year

Application Question(s):

* Are you willing to begin this role in an advisory capacity, with compensation in the form of equity until funding is secured?
* Are you comfortable participating in early leadership discussions and senior\-team selection prior to full funding?
* Are you willing to sign a non\-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) confirming interest in a future leadership role and allowing us to present your name and resume to investors?
* Do you understand that this opportunity is pre\-funding and does not include salary or benefits at the initial advisory stage?

Escalon Services is a Business Process Management (BPM) company that provides Essential Business Services (EBS) through a tech\-enabled platform to small\- and medium\-sized businesses (SMBs) and startups. The Company enables its clients to spend less time on ""back office"" functions and provides the value and insight that enables clients to spend more time focusing on delivering value and moving their businesses forward. With a US\-based remote workforce and global delivery team in India, Escalon’s solution fills a widening service gap in the SMB market, underpinned by (i) increasing demand for quality insights in an increasingly competitive marketplace (ii) decreasing supply of CPAs and quality in\-house talent and (iii) the cost frictions associated with scaling internal back\-office teams as businesses grow. For more information on Escalon: https://escalon.services/
Since founding, the company has executed both on an organic and M\&A strategy to expand service offerings and drive revenue expansion opportunity through cross\-sell/up\-sell. Before partnering with New Harbor Capital in late 2022, Escalon completed two significant acquisitions which tripled the revenue of the company and expanded the FinOps capabilities of the platform. Continued corporate development is a key value driver for the business going forward, with a highly fragmented market of service providers, often individually unable to scale due to lack of technology\-enablement and offshore capabilities.
In late 2022, New Harbor Capital made a growth equity investment in Escalon Services.

We’re building a new **B2B CRM** and are approaching our first launch. The product is nearly complete, development is handled, and we’re now looking for an experienced **Product Marketing / Go\-To\-Market consultant** to help us shape how this product is positioned, branded, and introduced to the market.

This is a **pre\-launch, early\-stage engagement**. There is no marketing team yet — you’ll be working directly with the founder to define the foundation.

This role is ideal for someone who has helped launch SaaS products before and enjoys turning complex products into clear, compelling market stories.

What You’ll Do

**Brand \& Positioning**

* Review and sanity\-check existing branding (logo, name, tone, visual direction)
* Ensure brand aligns with target customer expectations and trust signals
* Recommend improvements only where necessary (no unnecessary rebrands)

**Product Messaging \& Vision**

* Clarify ideal customer profile (ICP) and core use case
* Define the product’s primary value proposition and differentiation
* Translate founder vision into clear, customer\-facing messaging
* Help craft homepage headlines, pitch narrative, and demo story

**Go\-To\-Market Strategy**

* Define initial go\-to\-market plan for launch
* Recommend pricing posture, trial vs demo approach, and early traction strategy
* Identify the most realistic early acquisition channels
* Create a simple, focused launch roadmap (lean, not flashy)

**Founder Collaboration**

* Act as a strategic partner and thought partner
* Ask tough questions and challenge assumptions when needed
* Help avoid common early\-stage SaaS marketing mistakes

What We’re Looking For

**Required Experience**

* Proven experience in **Product Marketing, GTM, or Fractional CMO roles**
* Background in **B2B SaaS** (CRM experience is a strong plus)
* Experience launching products from **pre\-launch to first customers**
* Strong positioning, messaging, and market\-strategy skills

**Nice to Have**

* Experience working with early\-stage founders
* Familiarity with founder\-led sales or early revenue validation
* Ability to balance strategy with practical execution

What This Is (and Isn’t)

**This is:**

* Strategic, hands\-on, early\-stage work
* High\-impact foundational role
* Flexible, fractional, short\-term engagement (with potential to extend)

**This is NOT:**

* A social media or content posting role
* A junior marketing position
* A large\-budget brand redesign project

Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) \& Cultural Officer

* How Quentasia’s identity is articulated and protected
* How audiences discover and connect with our stories

* Balance cultural relevance with measurable performance outcomes.

Sponsorships, Partnerships \& Revenue Collaboration

* Collaborate with corporate sponsors, foundations, and cultural institutions to create aligned partnerships.
* Help shape sponsorship and brand integration strategies that respect creative integrity while driving revenue.
* Partner cross\-functionally to ensure marketing supports both commercial and mission\-driven goals.

Team Building \& Organizational Growth

* Build and lead a marketing organization that scales with the studio’s growth.
* Establish systems, workflows, and creative standards that enable consistency across multiple projects.
* Mentor and develop talent with an emphasis on inclusive leadership and creative excellence.

Ideal Candidate Profile

* Senior marketing leader with experience in entertainment, media, streaming, consumer brands, or cultural institutions.
* Demonstrated ability to build brands and communities with both cultural credibility and commercial impact.
* Proven success leading integrated campaigns and brand partnerships with clear ROI.
* Strong strategic instincts paired with hands\-on execution capability.
* Deep appreciation for culture, representation, and audience trust as strategic assets.
* Entrepreneurial mindset and comfort operating in a lean, evolving environment.
* A collaborative leader who can partner effectively with creative, finance, and executive leadership.

* Active participation in shaping studio identity, audience strategy, and leadership culture
* Advisory equity participation to reflect early belief and contribution
* Full compensation package (salary \+ equity) activated post\-funding

You will co\-create the identity and trajectory of a studio committed to storytelling that resonates deeply, travels widely, and endures—building trust with audiences while driving meaningful, sustainable growth.

Pay: $220,000\.00 \- $245,000\.00 per year

Application Question(s):

* Are you willing to begin this role in an advisory capacity, with compensation in the form of equity until funding is secured?
* Are you comfortable participating in early leadership discussions and senior\-team selection prior to full funding?
* Are you willing to sign a non\-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) confirming interest in a future leadership role and allowing us to present your name and resume to investors?

**Company:** Purrfect Portal  
**Location:** Remote (US\-based preferred)  
**Reports to:** Founder \& CEO (Lisa Harrington)

About Purrfect Portal

Purrfect Portal is a fast\-growing omnichannel consumer brand serving passionate pet owners through DTC, Amazon, Chewy, and future national retail partners. The company is entering a multi\-year scale phase with ambitions for significant channel expansion, product innovation, and long\-term enterprise value creation.

The Role

We are seeking a hands\-on, execution\-oriented COO to own operational leadership, channel performance, and cross\-functional alignment. This role is responsible for translating strategy into reality and ensuring the business can scale profitably and predictably.

This is a builder role — ideal for an operator who thrives in growth\-stage environments and enjoys creating clarity out of complexity.

Core Responsibilities

Channel Operations \& Performance

* Own operational performance across **Amazon, Shopify, and Chewy**
* Ensure inventory availability, launch readiness, and promotional execution
* Coordinate with internal teams responsible for listings, marketing, and fulfillment

* Manage retailer.com expansion and ensure cross\-functional readiness
* Coordinate execution with brokers, buyers, and external partners
* Define and document workflows between internal teams, brokers, and retailers
* Ensure ecommerce and retail channels can scale simultaneously without destabilizing the core business

EAM Leadership \& Cross\-Functional Alignment

* Build and own SOPs, workflows, and accountability systems
* Align operations, marketing, fulfillment, finance, and admin
* Implement operating rhythms, KPIs, and reporting
* Design a scalable org structure tied to revenue milestones
* Reduce founder dependency through clear ownership and systems

Operations \& Production

* Own day\-to\-day factory and production operations (US\-based manufacturing)
* Manage production timelines, POs, quality control, and issue resolution
* Translate inventory strategy into executable manufacturing plans
* Partner closely with inventory planning lead on forecasting, reorders, and risk mitigation

Who You Are

* Proven operator in ecommerce or omnichannel consumer brands
* **Has led an ecommerce or DTC\-first brand through successful retail expansion** (e.g., Walmart, Target, specialty retail)
* Deep understanding of how retail impacts inventory planning, cash flow, margins, and operations
* Experience working with brokers, buyers, and retail operations teams
* Comfortable with ambiguity and building systems from scratch
* Strong communicator with factories, partners, and internal teams
* Systems\-minded but deeply execution\-oriented
* Able to balance strategic thinking with hands\-on follow\-through
* Calm under pressure and confident owning decisions

Required Experience

* **Direct experience launching and scaling at least one brand into brick\-and\-mortar or national retail**
* Experience managing complexity across DTC, marketplaces, and wholesale channels
* Experience owning or partnering closely on operations, supply chain, and channel execution

Role Structure \& Time Commitment

This role will begin as a **fractional COO position**, averaging **20–25 hours per week**.

Hours may flex higher during onboarding, systems build\-out, or key initiatives (e.g., production transitions or retail readiness), and lighter during steady\-state periods.

As the business scales — particularly with increased retail complexity, team growth, or active national retail launches — this role may evolve into a **full\-time position by mutual agreement**.

What This Role Is Not

* Not a corporate or big\-company COO role with existing infrastructure
* Not a passive advisor or strategy\-only position
* Not a pure supply chain or inventory\-planning role
* Not a marketing, growth, or paid media role
* Not a 9–5, task\-ticket–driven job

This role is for an operator who wants ownership, accountability, and real impact in a growing consumer brand.

What Success Looks Like (12–18 Months)

* Day\-to\-day operations run without founder involvement
* Production and inventory execution are predictable and well\-documented
* Channel performance is stable, visible, and accountable
* Retail expansion initiatives are operationally sound and execution\-ready
* The organization operates with clear roles, workflows, and metrics
* The business is prepared to scale retail without compromising core ecommerce performance

You have a breadth of knowledge of HR employment law and employee relations in multiple states (California and New York are ideal!). You bring skills in client and project management, attention to detail, and stellar written and verbal communication, along with an ability to guide an organization, its leadership and its people through change.
  

You thrive in environments where you don’t know the answer but are willing to do the work and figure it out, enjoy creating HR policies and programs from the ground up and working in a fast\-paced and changing environment. You find joy in meaningful work and delivering excellent client results. At Humani, no two days are the same. If this sounds like a great fit for you, we encourage you to apply!  

**We are looking for a Texas\-based HR Business Partner to join our team. At Humani, our hybrid work model means working primarily remotely, with onsite support at various client sites based on business needs. As such, local and international travel may be required from time to time.**

* **Analytical, problem solving, and critical thinking:** HRBPs need to be able to absorb a great deal of information about the client's business and what they are looking for Humani to accomplish for them. This then needs to be analyzed to make clear recommendations, followed by the execution of the solution.
* **Time Management:** HRBPs must actively manage their time to meet deadlines and remain within the client's budget.
* **Listening, verbal communication, and interpersonal skills:** HRBPs need to interact with many of the client's executives and employees regularly. As such, effective communication skills and heightened self\-awareness are a must.

* **Creativity:** We’re looking for outside\-the\-box thinkers! Our HRBPs have the flexibility and creativity to handle any situations that arise while implementing solutions for the client.
* **Self\-motivation and self\-discipline:** This is a highly autonomous role where HRBPs work independently supporting clients and must be self\-motivated to complete work promptly with minimal oversight. We aren’t just strategic partners – we do the work and give our clients full white glove service.

  

**Our Company Perks!**We know we are looking for top\-tier skills and experience. But that’s because we offer top\-tier compensation and benefits, which include:* Base salary $80,000\-$100,000 with potential to earn up to 10\-25\+% of base salary through our annual performance\-based bonus program (Total compensation up to $88,000\-$125,000\+).

Our products are sold direct\-to\-consumer and are increasingly gaining traction with professional users such as landscapers, garden centers, and institutional buyers.

Our products can be viewed on the below websites:

www.smartcarts.com

www.infinitecedar.com

We are seeking an experienced, hands\-on operator to help us build and execute growth through pallet programs targeting landscapers, garden centers, equestrian supply stores, marinas, and instructional buying channels— without adding heavy overhead or management layers.

**Role Summary**

We are hiring a **fractional, part\-time Retail \& B2B Expansion Lead** to own and execute our expansion into:

* Regional garden center chains
* Landscaper / contractor programs
* Select institutional buyers (equestrian supply stores, marinas, parks, campuses, etc.)

This is a **builder role**, not a “strategy\-only” position. You will be responsible for developing the programs, opening accounts, and creating repeatable processes that allow Smart Carts to scale without the founder becoming a bottleneck.

The role is ideal for someone who has:

* Led retail or B2B expansion at a small\-to\-mid\-sized consumer or durable goods company
* Strong relationships or experience with independent garden centers, regional chains, or pro customers
* A bias toward execution, not bureaucracy

**Responsibilities**

**Retail Expansion**

* Develop pilot programs (10–50 store tests)
* Negotiate wholesale pricing, terms, and seasonal buy\-ins

* Build a simple outbound and inbound sales process
* Close initial anchor accounts and create repeatable playbooks

**Program \& Process Development**

* Help define a small number of “program SKUs” optimized for B2B and retail
* Build simple tools: pitch decks, one\-pagers, pricing sheets, reorder workflows
* Create a clear handoff process so accounts can be managed efficiently over time

**Collaboration**

* Work directly with the founder and operations team
* Provide clear feedback on pricing, packaging, and product\-market fit
* Recommend where additional investment (inventory, tooling, marketing) is justified by demand

**What This Role Is** ***Not***

* Not a big\-box national account executive role (yet)
* Not a people\-management role
* Not a strategy\-only advisory role
* Not a commission\-only sales job

This is a **hands\-on growth operator role**.

**Time Commitment**

* **10–20 hours per week**, flexible
* Remote\-friendly with potential occasional travel for key accounts (if needed)

**Compensation Structure**

We are intentionally designing this role to be affordable, performance\-aligned, and motivating.

**Path to expanded role** as volume grows (optional, not promised or required)

**Ideal Background**

* 7\+ years in retail sales, wholesale, or B2B expansion
* Experience with:
* Garden centers, outdoor products, tools, equipment, equestrian product sales, or durable consumer goods
* Regional retail chains and/or pro customer sales
* Comfortable selling products in the $200–$600 retail price range
* Entrepreneurial mindset; comfortable working without a large support team

**Why This Role Is Attractive**

* Real ownership of a growth function at an inflection point
* Direct impact on company scale and strategy
* High autonomy
* No corporate politics
* Clear upside if programs succeed
* Opportunity to grow with the business if mutually desired

Pay: $3,000\.00 \- $5,000\.00 per month

Benefits:

* Work from home

Application Question(s):

* Please provide a short note on your experience with retail, garden centers, or B2B programs
* Please share examples of accounts or channels you have helped launch or scale
* Please confirm that you are interested in a fractional / part\-time role

Experience:

* Sales: 5 years (Required)
