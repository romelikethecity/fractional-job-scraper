=======================


Fractional AI builds bespoke software to help organizations solve complex, high\-impact problems.


Every C\-suite in the country is trying to bridge the gap between AI in theory and AI in practice. We close this gap with exceptional engineering talent and custom end\-to\-end AI builds (see some of our case studies to learn more).


By joining Fractional AI, you’re stepping onto a San Francisco, NYC, NC, and Dubai\-based team working on AI projects for top companies from the comfort of an engineering\-first startup.


Fractional AI is launching a new enterprise division, which is physically headquartered in the Triangle of North Carolina. The enterprise division is initially focused on healthcare and life sciences (an area where our leadership team has deep experience), with plans to expand into other industries as we grow. This unique opportunity allows you to be a part of the founding team to help build the division from scratch, but with the stability and resources of an established and profitable startup.

**About the Role**
==================


Joining Fractional AI as a Forward\-Deployed Software Engineer, you’ll play a leading role in building and shipping AI applications for our customers \- from understanding customer needs to deploying solutions in their environments \- all while shaping our engineering and broader Fractional culture for the next 100\+ engineers.


“Forward\-deployed” means we combine software engineering with customer\-facing problem solving, owning delivery from early scoping through deployment and iteration. You’ll spend most of your time coding, but close enough to customers to shape the right solution end\-to\-end.


By the time you’ve completed your second project, you’ll have shipped LLM applications across more companies and use cases than the vast majority of AI engineers in the world.

**What you bring to the table**
===============================

* You write exceptional code \+ deeply care about the craft of coding (5\+ years of experience): you build elegant, production\-ready code; you have strong proficiency across multiple programming languages.
* You are excited about AI. Many strong candidates will be building AI systems for the first time in a production context, so curiosity and learning speed matter more to us than prior buzzword exposure.
* You love solving hard, new problems: you are comfortable self\-teaching, asking “why?,” and experimenting to solve problems you haven’t seen before.
* You thrive in high\-ownership environments: you take initiative, function well with limited structure, and enjoy shaping how work is done. Whether you come from prior start\-up experience or a mature organization, you have owned internal systems, shipped production software, and/or made the transition from data/ML work into scalable engineering.
* You are comfortable talking with users: you deeply care about the user and skillfully navigate user conversations to ensure what we’re building meets their needs.
* You are a great teammate: you are comfortable helping others (and asking for help), you champion integrity in everything, and want to build a one\-in\-a\-career culture of personal growth.

**What you'll do**
==================

* Design and develop custom AI solutions tailored to the unique needs of our customers, ensuring seamless integration and scalability.
* Partner with a high\-caliber team across the full project lifestyle, from requirements gathering, to prototyping, system design, coding, testing, deployment, and support.
* Actively shape our engineering and broader company culture \- from how we learn, to how we hire, to how we celebrate \- you’ll shape how we make Fractional a place we all love working.

**Our tech stack**
==================

* We’re generally tech stack agnostic \- we work in our customers’ environments and code bases, so we choose tools based on their needs rather than fixed preferences. A lot, but definitely not all, of our work is in Python, Typescript, Vercel, and Terraform.
* After working at Fractional AI for a few years, you’ll become fluent in the modern applied AI stack (e.g., LangGraph, DSPy, VLLM), from foundation model APIs to evaluation tools (e.g., Braintrust, Pydantic, InspectAI), as well as retrieval and deployment frameworks (e.g., OpenPipe, Pinecone, ChromaDB).

**A day in the life**
=====================

* You're on a ""Project Team"" designed for that client's high\-impact AI need\- it may be automating a call center with AI phone agents or building an AI content moderation system – each project is different.
* You’ll dive into one of the higher priority items for the morning (say building out an evals suite). You have a weekly standup with the customer (the CTO at the client) to chat through tradeoffs, progress, and timeline.
* You join team lunch (which doubles as the Fractional AI cross\-project standup) to hear about different projects we’re working on … the lunch will turn into a lively debate about Weights and Biases v. Braintrust capabilities.
* You’ll have some solo heads down time to continue jamming on the high priority pieces for that print.
* Maybe you join a prospective customer call to share your perspective on what’s technically feasible on that potential project.
* We move quickly, but sustainably, and believe strong execution comes from good judgment, not burnout.

**Who you'll work with**
========================

* You’ll report to Rebecca, who leads our Enterprise engineering team, and will also collaborate closely with Kyle, who leads Enterprise sales and business development.
* You’ll work very closely with other engineers on the Enterprise team \- most project teams consist of 2\-5 engineers and a Forward\-Deployed Product Manager. We also love collaborating and knowledge\-sharing with our counterparts in the SF, NYC, and Dubai offices (we’re all on the same Slack, which makes that easy even across time zones).
* You’ll also spend time partnering with Eddie, our Co\-Founder and CTO, our CEO, Chris, and Chairman, Travis.

**Why you should (and shouldn’t) join us**
==========================================


We’re big believers in transparency and know joining a company is a big decision. We’re not the best fit for everyone and try to be clear on what we are and what we’re not so you make the choice that’s right for you.

**Why join Fractional?**
------------------------

* Build on the forefront of applied AI: You’ll have a front row seat to how the world’s leading companies are actually deploying AI solutions. By the time you’ve completed your second project, you’ll have shipped LLM applications across more companies and use cases than the vast majority of AI engineers in the world.
* Solve big, real problems: Companies come to us when they can’t solve some of their biggest problems themselves. For you, that means learning everyday, never getting bored, and working across a range of industries, customers, and products.
* Learn with and from the best in person: We're a team of senior engineers (some former founders, some former engineering leaders) who only want to work on high\-impact projects. Working elbow to elbow in our NC office means things like team lunches, quick brainstorming, and the right amount of banter.

**Why shouldn't you join Fractional?**
--------------------------------------

* Preference for just speed or quality: We love hacking things together for a proof of concept but ultimately our code will be put into production in our customers’ environments \- you need to enjoy balancing elegance and expediency.
* Predictability is important to you: You’ll be working across customers, programming languages, industries and projects, which means you won’t be becoming an expert in the same product suite or serving the same user day after day.
* Customers aren’t your thing: You’ll spend most of your time coding but will be closer to the customer than in most engineering roles. You’ll frequently interact with engineers from the customer’s team to ask questions and problem solve. A deep understanding and appreciation of the customer is crucial.

=======================


Fractional AI builds bespoke software to help organizations solve complex, high\-impact problems.


Every C\-suite in the country is trying to bridge the gap between AI in theory and AI in practice. We close this gap with exceptional engineering talent and custom end\-to\-end AI builds (see some of our case studies to learn more).

This unique opportunity allows you to be a part of the founding team to help build the division from scratch, but with the stability and resources of an established and profitable startup.

**About the role**
==================


Our clients come to us with ambitious, often fuzzy goals—*make content moderation faster*, *customer service cheaper and better*, *unlock new integrations*, *automate the workflows no one else can touch*.


Your job is to turn those goals into AI\-powered solutions that actually work in the real world—and to own the journey from first conversation live system real business impact.


This is a **forward\-deployed, full\-stack client role**:

* Part **engagement manager** (you’re the primary face of Fractional to the client)
* Part **product manager** (you decide what we build and why)
* Part **delivery/program manager** (you run the execution motion end\-to\-end)
* Part **“do whatever it takes” operator** (you jump into the gaps to keep things moving)

**What you’ll do**
==================

**Own the client relationship end\-to\-end**

* Act as the client’s day\-to\-day strategic partner and primary point of contact.
* Join early\-stage calls, run discovery, synthesize feedback, and keep clients aligned on what we’re building and why.
* Build trusted relationships across all levels of an organization, setting clear expectations and being candid about tradeoffs.

**Shape what we build and why**

* Define product builds, refine and sequence scope, and identify the highest\-leverage use cases.
* Translate ambiguous business problems into crisp problem statements, user journeys, and success metrics.
* Work with clients to define what “success” actually means—then design experiments, KPIs, and dashboards to prove it.

**Turn messy problems into shipped solutions**

* Translate ambiguous client needs into clear requirements, PRDs, and plans for engineers.
* Shape workflows, edge cases, evaluation criteria, and deployment success metrics for AI\-powered systems.
* Sit in the loop with engineering: prioritization, tradeoffs, testing, evals, and launches.

**Drive execution across multiple AI builds**

* Run the day\-to\-day execution rhythm: stand\-ups, planning, check\-ins, risk/issue tracking, and runway management.
* Coordinate between clients, engineers, designers, and other Fractional teammates to keep projects unblocked and moving.
* Own timelines and delivery quality—getting projects across the finish line consistently and calmly, even when things change late.

**Help create demand, not just fulfill it**

* Jump on early, messy conversations where the “project” is still a vague idea.
* Help founders and sales tease out real pain, sketch solution approaches live, and scope engagements that we can actually deliver.
* Spot expansion opportunities and help turn successful deployments into broader, long\-term partnerships.

**Drive adoption and long\-term impact**

* Work with client teams on rollout, enablement, and change management—so the systems you build actually get used.
* Monitor performance, gather qualitative and quantitative feedback, and push for improvements where they matter most.
* Bring back insights and patterns that inform Fractional’s internal playbooks, tooling, and product direction.

**Bring judgment and clarity**

* When requirements are fuzzy, data is messy, or clients change course, you’ll break the problem down and guide everyone toward the highest\-impact solution.
* Be the person in the room who can say, “Here’s what we’re actually trying to do, here’s what we know, here’s the plan.”

**What you bring**
==================

**Client\-facing, high\-stakes experience**

* You’ve led projects where clients were under pressure, stakeholders weren’t aligned, and the path wasn’t obvious.
* You’re comfortable pushing back, reframing the problem, and holding the line on quality.

**Real product \& delivery experience**

* You’ve built and shipped products or services in partnership with engineers and designers—ideally across multiple cycles.
* You know how to run an execution rhythm (stand\-ups, planning, tracking, retros) without turning it into process theater.

**Structured problem\-solving and communication**

* You ask good questions, structure chaos, and turn ambiguity into a plan.
* You can go from whiteboarding with execs to writing a crisp doc for engineers without losing the plot.

**Bias for action and ownership**

* You roll up your sleeves and make things happen, whether that’s writing a scrappy SQL query, drafting a support playbook, or jumping into a last\-minute exec demo.

**Experience range**

* Typically 4–8 years in product, consulting, implementations, or any role where execution and client trust mattered more than your job title. (We care more about what you’ve done than the exact label on your resume.)

**Comfort with ambiguity and intensity**

* You like high\-energy environments, messy problems, and “we haven’t done this before” projects.
* You can juggle multiple clients, keep priorities straight, and make good calls with incomplete information.

**AI curiosity, not AI dogma**

* You don’t need deep AI expertise on day one. You do need curiosity, strong reasoning, and a desire to learn fast—and to overuse AI in your own workflow.

**In your first 30 days, you might...**
=======================================

* Take full ownership of a live client project and become their primary point of contact.
* Run discovery sessions and turn a fuzzy problem into a clear plan for engineers, complete with success metrics and a first milestone.
* Lead regular client meetings, track progress, and keep delivery smooth—flagging risks early and offering options instead of surprises.
* Guide high\-stakes moments—like demoing a prototype to a CTO or VP, handling sharp questions, and steering the conversation toward outcomes.
* Kick off a second project in a totally different industry, learning new workflows on the fly.
* Overuse AI: from note\-taking and research to drafting docs and testing prototypes.
* Plug into Fractional’s rhythm—from Project Lunch \& Learns to our monthly Happy Hour—and start shaping how we deliver applied AI, not just what we deliver.

**Why you should (and shouldn’t) join us**
==========================================


We believe in transparency and know joining a company is a big decision. We’re not the best fit for everyone and try to be clear on what we are and what we’re not so you make the choice that’s right for you.

***Why join Fractional?***

* A front\-row seat to the AI revolution: In one year at Fractional AI, you will have led many 0\-to\-1 gen AI builds for leading companies, quickly becoming an expert in applied AI.
* A huge and growing problem space: Getting gen AI into production is the challenge of our time – with legacy consulting firms already driving several billion dollars per year on gen AI advising revenue. Most offerings on the market don’t meet the need – they are one size fits all product solutions or advising services without the engineering team to deliver. We offer the engineering talent to meet the need.
* A team of veteran founders: The team is built from multi\-time founders and co\-founded by Travis May, former CEO of LiveRamp and founder \+ former CEO of Datavant.

***Why you shouldn't join?***

* We are unapologetically building an engineering\-first culture. This is how we build the team to meet the moment. We overdeliver for our clients by crafting a culture that enables the best engineers to thrive.
* We are a professional services business. Building for clients and their customers is distinctly different from building for your own product’s customer or users. It’s not for everyone.
* We are in\-person. We’re committed to building an in\-person team in North Carolina. This enables us to learn faster together. For the right person, this is a pro, not a con, but it’s non\-negotiable.

We've launched over a dozen credit card programs, including for Coinbase, Bilt, and Qatar Airways. We help businesses bring imaginative card programs to life, and have pioneered technology to embed credit card features natively into their products.


We value curiosity, humility, and intensity — we move fast and take outsized ownership. This is a place where a motivated, resourceful individual can have an enormous impact on our trajectory. We're headquartered in San Francisco, and have raised about $150M in equity funding from top venture capital firms including Spark Capital, American Express, Activant Capital, and more.

**The Job**
-----------


We're looking for a Head of Talent to build and lead recruiting at Cardless. You'll report directly to our COO and work closely with our founders. This isn't a function that gets delegated and forgotten — leadership is in the weeds on hiring because we believe it's the highest\-leverage thing we do. At our stage, each hire over the next year can meaningfully change the trajectory of the business. We want someone who feels the weight of that.


This is our first full\-time recruiting hire, but you won't be starting from scratch. We've used outsourced recruiters and fractional help to build a foundation — your job is to take it from here and make it yours. You'll have the opportunity to shape the function in your vision while inheriting some momentum.


We're planning to grow significantly over the next year. You'll own that hiring plan end\-to\-end: sourcing, closing, and building a small team to give yourself leverage. This is a hands\-on role — we're not looking for someone who wants to manage from above.

**Responsibilities**
--------------------

* Own full\-cycle recruiting across all functions, with a near\-term focus on engineering, operations, and GTM.
* Build the recruiting function: hiring plan, process, tooling, employer brand, candidate experience — all of it.
* Build and lead a lean recruiting team that scales thoughtfully with hiring demand, prioritizing efficiency, strong processes, and clear ownership over simply adding headcount.
* Partner with hiring managers to define roles, calibrate on candidates, and close offers.
* Be a closer. Do extraordinary things on an ordinary basis to get candidates over the line. We're competing for great people in a highly competitive market.
* Move fast. We have aggressive hiring goals and need someone who can keep pace.

**Requirements**
----------------

* 5\+ years of recruiting experience at tech companies, with meaningful time spent on engineering roles.
* Experience building or significantly scaling a recruiting function — or you're a senior IC ready to step up and own it.
* Hands\-on. You're not looking to manage a team from a distance; you want to be in the work.
* High bar for talent. You know what great looks like and you're not willing to settle.
* Creative and relentless closer. You don't just follow the playbook — you find new ways to win.
* Organized and fast. You can run multiple searches in parallel without dropping balls.
* San Francisco\-based and excited to be in\-office 5 days a week.

**Before You Apply**
--------------------


A few things worth knowing:

* **We work in the office 5 days a week.** We know that's a dealbreaker for some people, and that's okay.
* **This is an early\-stage company.** We're \~40 people servicing hundreds of thousands of customers. You'll be building systems that don't exist yet, not optimizing ones that do. If you want structure handed to you, this isn't the right fit.
* **You'll need to push yourself.** We're not going to give you a playbook or check in daily to make sure you're on track. You need to be someone who creates their own direction and holds themselves accountable.
* **The pace is intense and this role is hands\-on.** We have aggressive goals and a lot to build — this isn't a 9\-to\-5\. You'll be expected to build out a team, but to give you leverage, not to make you a full\-time manager. You'll be sourcing and closing candidates yourself — not just managing a team or running process from above.
* **We expect out\-of\-the\-box thinking.** If your idea of closing a candidate is a nice phone call and a follow\-up email, this job isn't for you. We want someone who texts their candidates, shows up in person, does whatever it takes. Out\-of\-the\-box methods are the only way to achieve out\-of\-the\-box results — in hiring and across the business.

We deliver high\-caliber accounting and finance leadership and support to entrepreneurs and management teams building scalable, high\-growth companies.

**This is a phone\-first role.** You'll be calling investor lists, having conversations, and booking qualified leads for our closers. If you don't like being on the phone, this isn't for you.


**Why so flexible?** We're a startup in stealth mode building our investor relations team. We're looking for people who can prove they can do the work — not just talk about it.


### **About Us**


We're a credible, **funded**, remote\-first startup led by a serial technical founder. The product is live in private alpha.


We can't share much about what we're building yet — we're in stealth mode. What we can tell you: we have real traction, real investors, and a real opportunity for the right people.


Learn more about our founder, team, and comp structures at **list\-lab.org**.


### **About The Role**


**Prove it first, then we talk.**


We're not looking for resumes and interviews. We're looking for results. Here's how it works:


* You apply
* You deliver 2 qualified investor leads in 2 weeks
* Email us at **IR@CoreList.org** with your name and for each lead: their name, phone number, and a short blurb about who they are
* If you deliver, you're in — paid per lead, CRM access, ongoing support
* If you don't, no hard feelings — we part ways


A qualified lead \= an accredited investor who's ready to talk about investing in a funded tech startup. You figure out how to find them. That's the test.


This is a contest, not a committee. The people who produce get to stay.


### **Compensation**


**Pay\-per\-lead.** You deliver a qualified lead, you get paid. No salary, no hourly, no employment relationship. This is contractor work (1099\).


Once you're in, you get CRM access, scripts, and support — but you're always paid for results, not time. Top performers may transition to more permanent arrangements.


### **What Success Looks Like in 2 Weeks**


* You've sourced and called potential investors
* You've had real conversations
* You've delivered 2 qualified leads (accredited investors ready to talk about investing)
* You've shown you can produce without hand\-holding


### **What You'll Do (Once You're In)**


* Make outbound calls to investor lists
* Qualify leads (accredited investor status, interest level)
* Book qualified leads for follow\-up with our team
* Track your activity and results in our CRM (GoHighLevel)
* Ask for referrals on every call — expand the network


### **What You Won't Do (Once You're In)**


* **Pitch or sell the investment** — you qualify and book, our closers handle the rest
* **Work without accountability** — we track results, not hours


### **What We're Looking For**


* Experience making **high\-volume outbound calls** — sales, fundraising, appointment setting, collections, anything phone\-based
* **Thick skin** — you don't take rejection personally
* **Clear communicator** — professional, friendly, gets to the point
* **Self\-motivated** — you don't need someone watching over your shoulder
* Comfortable with **accredited investors** — high\-net\-worth individuals, executives, doctors, lawyers, successful professionals
* **Hungry** — you want to prove yourself and earn your spot


### **Why This Role is Different**


Most cold calling jobs are about grinding through a script for a paycheck. This one is about proving you can produce — and if you can, you get ownership in a funded startup.

* **Flexible Time:** Can do full\-time, part\-time, side\-gig (off\-hours), or fractional (contract).
* **Flexible Commitment:** Can do short\-term, long\-term, or intermittent.


**Why so flexible?** We're a FUNDED startup racing to launch end of Q1 2026\. That gives us just 3 months to stack features while raising additional working capital. Feel free to jump in, help us ship, then bounce \>\> or stick around. A successful launch translates into lots of permanent jobs for those that want them. We're also interested in long term ""side gig"" relationships, if that's what you're into — in our experience, a few expert hours often beat full\-time learning\-curve hours.


### **About Us**


We're a credible, **funded**, remote\-first startup led by a serial \[technical] founder, and backed by a 20\-person team. The product is live in private alpha.


Learn more about our founder, team, and comp structures at **list\-lab.org**.


### **About The Role**


This is a hybrid role that sits at the intersection of executive support and project coordination. You'll be the face and voice of the company on video calls with prospects across multiple functions — staffing candidates, business development leads, investor relations, and partnership conversations. You need **presence**.


**This is not an inbox triage role.** You won't be sorting emails or managing a to\-do list for someone else. You'll be driving conversations forward, ensuring stakeholders have the information they need, following up on tasks, and keeping projects moving. Calendar management is part of the job — but it's a means to an end, not the end itself.


Think of yourself as the connective tissue between leadership and everyone — internal teams and external prospects alike. You'll represent us professionally on video, coordinate across multiple workstreams, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.


### **Compensation**


Up to **$200,000** max total compensation in Tier 1 cities; cash and equity components to be negotiated (amount reflects combined cash and equity components).


### **What Success Looks Like in 30 Days**


* You've represented the company on video calls with prospects across staffing, BD, IR, and partnerships — and people remember you positively
* You've taken ownership of recruiting coordination, supporting multiple hiring managers across departments and keeping candidate pipelines moving
* You've taken ownership of calendar management and are proactively scheduling, rescheduling, and protecting time
* You've established a rhythm for following up on tasks — both your own deliverables and those assigned to other leaders — ensuring nothing stalls and conversations progress
* You've coordinated across stakeholders, ensuring the right people have the right information at the right time
* You've identified gaps in our coordination processes and proposed improvements


### **What You'll Do**


* **Be the face of the company on video** — represent us professionally in meetings with staffing candidates, BD prospects, investors, and partners; you'll often be the first impression
* **Own recruiting coordination** — conduct meet \& greet calls, coordinate candidate pipelines across channels, and represent the company to talent throughout the hiring process
* **Drive conversations forward** — ensure meetings have outcomes, follow\-ups happen, and stakeholders stay aligned
* **Coordinate projects across functions** — track deliverables, chase down blockers, and keep workstreams moving without micromanaging
* **Manage calendars strategically** — schedule meetings, protect focus time, and ensure the right people are in the right rooms
* **Keep stakeholders informed** — synthesize information, provide context, and reduce noise for leadership (internal and external)
* **Follow up relentlessly** — tasks don't slip through the cracks on your watch
* **Lead coordination resources** — oversee and direct EAs, AAs, and VAs as the team scales
* **Build scalable systems** — create templates, playbooks, and processes that reduce friction and increase velocity


### **What We're Looking For**


* **5\+ years** in a senior EA, Chief of Staff, project coordination, or operations role — ideally in a startup or high\-growth environment
* **Strong presence on video** — you're articulate, confident, and comfortable representing the company to strangers
* **Excellent verbal and written communication** — you can hold a conversation with executives, investors, and candidates alike
* **Experience leading EAs, AAs, or VAs** — you've managed or directed support staff before (preferred)
* **Project management skills** — you know how to track deliverables, manage timelines, and keep projects on track (preferred)
* **Recruiting experience** — you've coordinated hiring processes or conducted candidate screenings (preferred)
* **Organized and reliable** — you manage multiple workstreams without dropping balls
* **Proactive, not reactive** — you anticipate needs and act before being asked
* **Tech\-savvy** — comfortable with AI tools, calendar software, project management platforms, video conferencing, and automation
* Experience at a **venture\-backed startup** is a plus


### **What You're NOT**


* Not an inbox manager — we're not looking for someone to sort emails
* Not a task\-taker — you drive outcomes, not just execute instructions
* Not camera\-shy — if you're uncomfortable on video, this isn't the right fit


### **Why This Role is Different**


Most EA roles are about supporting one person. This one is about representing an entire company — being the professional, polished presence that prospects encounter across staffing, sales, fundraising, and partnerships.


You'll have real ownership. Real visibility. And the opportunity to build the coordination infrastructure that scales with us.


If you've been the person who quietly makes everything run smoothly — and you're ready for that to be recognized — this is your chance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you’re an established leadership consultant, executive coach, or former executive, you’re probably not looking for a “job.”

* You already have credibility.
* You already have trusted relationships.
* You already understand the reality inside organizations today.
* This opportunity is built for professionals in this position.

**The Context**

Organizations across industries are struggling with disengagement, mistrust, and cultural fragmentation. Not because leaders don’t care, but because most leadership solutions are generic, theoretical, or disconnected from real\-world dynamics. Relationship Media, LLC exists to address this problem directly.

Founded by a 20\-year law enforcement veteran and former S.W.A.T. commander, our work focuses on closing what many organizations are quietly losing billions to each year, **the Relationship Gap**; a breakdown in trust, connection, and leadership effectiveness.

**The Strategic Partner Model**

This is a selective, performance\-based strategic partnership designed for senior professionals who want to expand impact without building curriculum, programs, or infrastructure from scratch.

We provide a field\-tested, proprietary leadership system built around the widely adopted ***“Be Like Tony / Don’t Be Like Chad”***framework.

The methodology is practical, example\-driven, and immediately deployable with executives, leaders, and teams.

We supply:

* The complete leadership system and methodology
* Delivery infrastructure and materials
* A proven framework already in use across industries

You leverage:

* Your credibility
* Your relationships
* Your professional judgment

**How Strategic Partners Deploy the System**

There is no single required delivery model. Strategic Partners deploy the system in ways aligned with their background, strengths, and market access, including:

* Executive and leadership consulting
* Organizational development engagements
* Virtual and in\-person workshops
* Online and on\-demand leadership training
* Cohort\-based or group leadership programs

**Who This Is Designed For**

This partnership is best suited for professionals who:

* Are established leadership consultants, executive coaches, or advisors
* Are HR consultants or OD practitioners with organizational access
* Are retired or semi\-retired executives with trust\-based relationships
* Lead or operate boutique consulting or training firms
* Recognize that relationships, not funnels or gimmicks, drive opportunity

If you are early in your career, seeking training, or looking to build a network, this partnership will **not** be a fit.

**A Note on Structure**

* There are no required licensing fees, certification costs, or upfront purchases to participate as a Strategic Partner
* Compensation is earned exclusively through client engagement and performance
* The model is designed to reward credibility, execution, and long\-term client impact

**Next Step (If You’re Curious)**

Qualified professionals are invited to a brief, private conversation to determine mutual fit and alignment.

* No pressure.
* No selling.
* Just clarity.

At minimum, the conversation will provide a clearer view of how senior leadership development is evolving, and whether this partnership aligns with where you are professionally.

SIAA Xchange, LLC (“Xchange”) was created to unlock smarter, faster, and more profitable access to over $17 billion in premium controlled by the SIAA network. As the embedded MGA and wholesale platform aligned with SIAA, we are more than just a distribution partner, we are building the infrastructure that transforms how carriers connect to the largest network of independent agencies in the country.
  
Our goal is to provide markets with a direct, trusted, and efficient channel to profitable premium by solving real challenges agents face when placing business. We understand how to manage submission flow, curate underwriting, and deploy technology that eliminates the friction often found in traditional wholesale interactions.
  
  

Position Overview
  
  

SIAA Xchange is seeking a highly organized, execution\-focused Director of Marketing to fully own and operate all aspects of Xchange marketing. This is a true startup\-style leadership role — responsible for building the marketing engine from the ground up and driving adoption across the SIAA network (5,200\+ member agencies and all Master Agencies).
  
  

This role will lead strategy, manage internal and external resources, and execute across digital, webinar, field, and email campaigns. The ideal candidate is both a strategic thinker and a tactical doer — someone who thrives with autonomy, moves with urgency, and knows how to deliver results without relying on large\-team bureaucracy.
  
  

Key Responsibilities
  
  

* Strategy \& Planning
* Own and develop a comprehensive marketing roadmap for Xchange aligned to key business objectives and rollout cadence.
* Define annual and quarterly marketing goals, KPIs, and reporting metrics.
* Coordinate with SIAA distribution leaders to align timing, messaging, and market rollout strategy.
* Execution \& Campaigns
* Run monthly webinars for members and Master Agencies, including scheduling, content coordination, invitations, and follow\-up.
* Plan, write, design, and launch all outbound email campaigns across products, incentive programs, and announcements — owning deployment and performance tracking.
* Manage and grow Xchange’s digital and social presence building off current independent social media efforts and content drops.
* Track campaign performance (open rates, CTRs, webinar attendance, engagement) and create monthly reporting dashboards for the executive team and stakeholders.
* Collaboration \& Coordination
* Serve as Xchange’s point person with relevant SIAA departments (marketing, distribution, growth coaches), looping in stakeholders as needed while maintaining ownership of execution.
* Work with The Grist or other external vendors to scale campaign development, design, or digital execution.
* Align regularly with the CEO and CUO on emerging product priorities, carrier needs, and rollout support.
* Team \& Resource Management
* Identify and manage contract or fractional marketing support where needed (graphic design, CRM, copywriting, automation).
* Own marketing budget planning and vendor relationships.
* Help build internal marketing infrastructure including CRM workflows, campaign automation, list management, and segmentation.


Required Qualifications
  
  

* 5\+ years of experience in B2B marketing, ideally within insurance, MGA, wholesale brokerage, or SaaS/distribution environments.
* Proven track record of independently managing marketing campaigns from concept through execution.
* Strong writer with design sensibility and the ability to translate complex concepts into clear, agent\-friendly language.
* Hands\-on experience with email marketing platforms, webinar tools, CRM systems, and social media scheduling tools.
* Analytical mindset with the ability to track performance and report campaign effectiveness.
* Comfort working independently in a fast\-paced startup environment with high ownership and limited bureaucracy.


Preferred Attributes
  
* Self\-starter who thrives with autonomy and urgency.
* Excellent communicator who knows how to “loop in” strategically, not administratively.
* Respectful of structure but confident building new workflows where none exist.
* Strong alignment with Xchange’s culture of clarity, speed, and agent\-first execution.


Location \& Travel
  
* This role is remote with occasional travel to regional meetings and Knoxville, New Hampshire, or other key offices as needed.",,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Siaa,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are ready to scale our U.S. presence and are looking for a **Sales Architect \& Closer** to build the engine and drive revenue.

Your mandate is simple and demanding; **take a validated service offering and turn it into a repeatable revenue machine for the U.S. market.**

This is **not** a traditional job, a salary role, or a position for early\-career generalists. This is a selective, **performance\-based strategic partnership** designed for established executives, high\-level consultants, and veteran coaches who already possess a deep network of trusted relationships. If you have the influence but are tired of the ""time\-for\-money"" trap or the burden of developing new curriculum from the ground up, this was built for you.

**The Gap You’ll Bridge**

Organizations are currently facing a **$223B ""Relationship Gap""** characterized by disengagement and cultural fragmentation. While the market is saturated with ""generalist"" business coaches, the **2026 Standard** demands hyper\-specialization and hybrid delivery models.

We provide the **Relationship Leadership** system; A field\-tested, proprietary framework (built on the ""Be Like Tony / Don't Be Like Chad"" methodology) that allows you to deliver immediate, measurable transformation to your clients.

**Why This Partnership is Different**

* **The Gold Standard Model:** You will leverage a hybrid delivery model, blending live group calls with our on\-demand curriculum, which is proven to be the most scalable and profitable way to coach.
* **Turnkey Infrastructure:** We supply the complete system, notebook materials, and administrative back\-end; you provide the credibility and relationship.
* **Decouple Time from Income:** Move from $250/hour 1\-on\-1 sessions to $2,000\+ per hour by leading high\-impact micro\-communities (6–12 people).
* **No Buy\-In Fees:** There is no licensing fee, certification cost, or required program purchase to join our strategic partner group coaching team.

**This is a High\-Level Fit if You Are:**

* An established **Leadership Consultant or Executive Coach** looking to expand your toolkit.
* A **retired or semi\-retired Executive** with a powerful ""Rolodex"" and industry influence.
* An **HR or OD Practitioner** with existing access to organizational decision\-makers.
* A **Boutique Training Firm** seeking a proven system to generate recurring revenue.

**\*\*\*MANDATORY NEXT STEP\*\*\***

To ensure we don’t waste your time or ours, we require all interested parties to review our **Group Coaching Model Briefing** before applying.

Watch the short video here: **coachingvideo.relationshipmedia.net**

**Note:** If, after watching the briefing, you do not feel a strong alignment with our methodology or do not have an existing network to leverage, **please DO NOT apply.** We are looking for partners ready to deploy this system into existing high\-level relationships immediately.
