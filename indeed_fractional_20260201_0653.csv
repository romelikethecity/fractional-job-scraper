RDI operates a high complexity CLIA / CAP laboratory supporting clinical trials across the United States. Our reputation is built on medical credibility, regulatory integrity, and trust. As we continue to scale, experienced medical leadership is essential to ensure our work meets the highest clinical and regulatory standards.


This role offers the opportunity to contribute to meaningful, high impact diagnostics research without the demands of a full time operational position. Your expertise matters here, and your judgment carries real weight.

### **What We Do**


RDI helps diagnostic and medical device companies achieve FDA clearance faster by running clinical trials with speed, precision, and accountability. We focus exclusively on diagnostics and medical devices, areas that have long been underserved in clinical research.


Our work supports innovators bringing critical tools to market and ultimately improves patient care by reducing unnecessary delays and inefficiencies.

### **Our Story**


RDI is an overnight success years in the making.


We grew four times last year, but the foundation has been built over more than a decade. Founded in 2008 and professionalized in 2017 through a search fund acquisition, RDI was not built on venture burn. We are backed by long term operators and growth investors who believe in execution, discipline, and durability.


Over the past several years, we have expanded by doing the hard things right. We built real infrastructure, earned trust from enterprise customers, and delivered consistent results in a space dominated by large, slow incumbents.


No one has successfully built and scaled a modern CRO focused on diagnostics and medical devices in over fifteen years. The industry has been optimized for pharma, not speed, not precision, and not accountability.


RDI is the exception.

### **About the Role**


As Medical Director, you provide medical and regulatory oversight for RDI’s CLIA laboratory and clinical trial activities. You are the medical authority behind the work, ensuring compliance with CLIA, CAP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.


You will partner closely with the Head of Science and the Operations team, offering guidance, review, and sign off where medical judgment is required. This is a focused, respected role designed for an experienced physician or scientist who values impact, integrity, and thoughtful collaboration.

### **What You Will Do**

* Serve as Medical Director for RDI’s high complexity CLIA laboratory
* Ensure ongoing compliance with CLIA, CAP, and applicable state and federal regulations
* Support audits, inspections, and regulatory interactions
* Review and sign off on clinical protocols, reports, and laboratory documentation
* Provide medical guidance on test utilization, quality, and clinical validity
* Act as a trusted medical advisor to the scientific and operations teams

**Requirements**

### **Who You Are**

* You hold an MD or PhD and have served in a Medical Director or equivalent leadership role
* You have direct experience overseeing CLIA and CAP accredited laboratories
* You are eligible for California CAP certification and able to serve as Medical Director under California regulations
* You are confident engaging with regulators, inspectors, and auditors
* You communicate clearly, thoughtfully, and with credibility",,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Rdi,,,,,,,,,,,,

**Plunge \| Hybrid \| Full\-Time**

**About Plunge**

Plunge is on a mission to transform parent\-teen communication for the 15 million families struggling to break through teenage silence. We're the only app specifically designed to help parents listen more and lecture less during the most critical developmental years, in a time highly influenced by AI technology.

Founded by CEO Kathy Carlisle alongside her family (Jake Carlisle, CFO and Jalena Carlisle, Operations Manager), Plunge was born from Kathy's personal journey with MS and a profound realization: connection transcends physical ability. With 600\+ beta users, $30K raised on Kickstarter, and a clear path to $1\.64M ARR in 24 months, we're poised for significant growth as we raise $600K in pre\-seed funding.

This is a family business with a generational mission. We're building something that lasts, not chasing a quick exit. And we need a COO who shares that vision.

**Why This Role Exists**

Kathy is a visionary CEO with an authentic founder story, deep market insight, and the ability to build genuine connections with users, investors, and partners. She's brilliant at articulating the mission, developing strategy, and leading with empathy and authenticity.

What Plunge needs now is an operational partner who can turn that vision into executable systems, manage the day\-to\-day complexity of scaling a business, and serve as a strong public face for the company. Kathy lives with MS, which means her energy is best focused on strategic priorities rather than daily operations and constant public\-facing demands. She needs a COO who can step into these roles seamlessly while keeping her informed and ensuring the company stays aligned with her vision.

This isn't about working around a limitation. It's about building a partnership where complementary strengths create something greater than either person could achieve alone.

**What You'll Do**

**Strategic Operations**

* Translate Kathy's vision into actionable plans and own execution of company goals
* Build systems for project management, accountability, and cross\-functional coordination
* Monitor app analytics and keep Kathy and Jake informed with clear insights

**Team Leadership**

* Maintain strong internal communication across the organization
* Foster a culture of accountability, collaboration, and mission alignment

**Marketing \& Brand Management**

* Manage communication and collaboration with marketing agency handling content creation, newsletters, and campaigns
* Develop and execute marketing strategies aligned with Kathy's vision
* Plan and execute community events and activations
* Lead media outreach and relationship building
* Serve as primary public\-facing representative across social platforms, events, and partnerships

**Investor \& Partner Relations**

* Pitch Plunge to investors and partners as the primary presenter
* Attend investor calls to deliver presentations and answer operational questions
* Collaborate with agency managing the capital raise
* Build relationships with strategic partners and potential B2B clients

**Operations \& Administration**

* Oversee HR, legal compliance, vendor management, and contractor coordination
* Manage relationships with accountants, lawyers, app developers, and consultants
* Ensure data privacy compliance (COPPA) and customer data security
* Handle contract negotiations and partnership agreements

**Customer Success**

* Build systems for customer onboarding, support, and retention
* Monitor user feedback and prioritize feature enhancements
* Develop case studies and testimonials demonstrating Plunge's impact

**Who You Are**

**Required:**

* 5\+ years operational leadership in startups or mission\-driven organizations
* Proven revenue growth track record in SaaS, consumer apps, or subscription businesses
* Strong public speaking and presentation skills (comfortable pitching to investors)
* Strong project management, communication, and team leadership abilities
* Self\-starter who thrives in ambiguous, fast\-moving environments

**Personal Attributes:**

* Emotional Intelligence is appreciated in managing a family business passion and working with Kathy
* Mission\-aligned and genuinely care about helping families connect
* Humble, service\-oriented, and adaptable
* Comfortable in the spotlight and energized by public\-facing work
* Long\-term thinker building for decades, not quarters

**What Success Looks Like**

**First 90 Days:**

* Establish clear systems for task management and accountability
* Build strong working relationships with Kathy, Jake, Jalena, and the team
* Deliver your first investor pitch with confidence
* Create a 12\-month operational roadmap

**By Month 12:**

* **Hit $500K in revenue**
* Build scalable customer acquisition and retention systems
* Continue to grow Plunge’s social media presence by working with Jalena’s knowledge of the community
* Lead successful investor and partner pitches
* Execute 2\-3 successful community events
* Present clear analytics to the team regularly

**Compensation \& Benefits**

* Competitive salary: $90K\-$120K (depending on location and experience)
* Remote\-first work environment with flexibility
* Health benefits (medical, dental, vision) in development as Plunge continues to grow
* Mission\-driven culture where your work helps families reconnect

**How to Apply**

Submit your application through:

* **Resume or LinkedIn profile**
* **Cover letter** answering:
* Why does Plunge's mission resonate with you personally?
* Describe a time you represented a company in a public\-facing or leadership role. What was the result?
* What's your approach to supporting a visionary founder while maintaining operational excellence?

**No corporate buzzword bingo.** We want to hear your authentic voice.

**Plunge is an equal opportunity employer committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.**
