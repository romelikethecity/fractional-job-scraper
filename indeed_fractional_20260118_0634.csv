**Qualifications**

* Experience: 10\+ years of progressive experience in finance leadership roles, with demonstrated success scaling a startup or high\-growth SaaS company from early traction to $100M\+ in revenue.

**Summary**
-----------


* **Flexible Title:** Can tailor to reflect your skills \& experience.
* **Flexible Time:** Part\-time or project\-based preferred. Not a full\-time role.
* **Flexible Commitment:** Can do project sprints, ongoing retainer, or milestone\-based.


**Why fractional?** We launch end of Q1 2026\. We need a strategic communicator to help us tell our story.


### **About Us**


We're a credible, **funded**, remote\-first startup led by a serial \[technical] founder, and backed by a 20\-person team. The product is live in private alpha.


Learn more about our founder, team, and comp structures at **list\-lab.org**.


### **About The Role**


This is **not** a performance marketing or demand gen role. This is about **narrative architecture**.


We're creating a **new category** — which means we can't win by comparing features to competitors. There are no direct competitors. We need to help people understand *what this is*, *why it matters*, and *how it fits into workflows they already have*.


Our audience is **extremely diverse** — multiple personas with different pain points, backgrounds, and use cases. Your job is to craft messaging that resonates across all of them without becoming generic mush.


You'll own the story we tell and how we tell it — through our website, landing pages, blog content, and foundational messaging. This includes **both copy and UI design** — we need someone who can craft the words *and* the visual experience that brings them to life.


### **Compensation**


Up to **$350,000** annualized max total compensation (prorated for part\-time); cash and equity components to be negotiated (amount reflects combined cash and equity components).


For project\-based engagements, we're open to milestone\-based payments or monthly retainers.


### **What Success Looks Like in 60 Days**


* You've developed a **messaging framework** that speaks to multiple audience segments without fragmenting the brand
* You've **designed the primary website pages** — homepage, product pages, about page — with both the UI/visual design and copy that educates rather than sells
* You've created **landing page designs** for key personas, with at least 1 live pages (copy \+ UI) for each of dozens of target personas
* You've established a **blog/content strategy** that positions us as the thought leader in this emerging category
* You've built a **brand style guide** covering voice, tone, visual identity, typography, color palette, and UI patterns that can scale with future hires
* You've defined the **visual language** — how we use imagery, iconography, whitespace, and motion to reinforce our narrative


### **What You'll Do**


* **Tell our story** — develop the core narrative that explains what we're building, why it matters, and who it's for
* **Design the website** — create the UI/visual design and copy for primary pages, landing pages, and blog (Figma, Webflow, or similar)
* **Own the full page experience** — information architecture, layout, typography, imagery, copy, and interaction patterns
* **Create messaging for diverse audiences** — craft copy that resonates with multiple avatars without feeling diluted or generic
* **Educate, don't compare** — help people understand how to apply this new thing to their existing workflows (we're not competing on features; we're creating a new category)
* **Build design and content systems** — establish UI components, templates, and guidelines that the team can execute on after you've set the direction
* **Define visual identity** — color, typography, iconography, imagery style, and how these reinforce the brand narrative
* **Set the editorial and visual tone** — define the voice and look that will carry through all touchpoints, from blog posts to onboarding emails


### **What We're Looking For**


* Proven experience in **brand storytelling, category creation, and foundational messaging** at a startup or early\-stage company
* Strong portfolio showing **website design (UI) AND copy** — you've done both, not just one
* Experience **speaking to audiences of varying sophistication** simultaneously — from seasoned VCs to first\-time investors, from power users to complete beginners — without talking down or over anyone's head
* Experience messaging to **diverse, multi\-segment audiences** without defaulting to lowest\-common\-denominator copy
* Comfortable with **""explain the new""** — you've helped audiences understand unfamiliar products or services before
* **Strategic thinker who can also execute** — you can set direction, design the page, and write the first draft
* Strong visual design sensibility — typography, layout, color, imagery, whitespace
* Comfortable working **fractionally** — you've juggled multiple clients and know how to deliver value in limited hours
* Experience with **category creation** or **""blue ocean"" positioning** is a major plus
* Startup experience preferred — you know how to move fast with imperfect information


### **What You're NOT**


* Not a social media manager (though you may inform social strategy)
* Not a performance marketer or demand gen specialist
* Not someone who needs a big team to be effective
* Not a feature\-comparison copywriter — if your instinct is ""vs. Competitor X,"" this isn't the right fit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanism builds profitable companies and turns them into enterprises.


Since 2019, we’ve launched and scaled 10 companies while driving $200M\+ in revenue by treating company\-building as an engineering problem—not an art project. We combine rigorous validation, advanced analytics, and repeatable systems to dramatically increase the odds of success.


Today, we are pushing that model further: building an operating system for entrepreneurship that allows us to launch profitable, reinvesting companies with speed, precision, and minimal waste—companies designed to reach millions, and eventually billions, of people.


This role sits at the center of that system.

**The Role**
------------


The **Startup Growth Lead** is a founding\-level growth operator embedded full\-time in a single, heavily pre\-validated startup.

* You are not searching for an idea.
* You are not fighting bureaucracy.
* You are not spread thin across functions.


You are brought in to **build and prove the growth engine**—fast.


You will own growth end\-to\-end, from first experiments through repeatable, profitable scale. Your job is to turn a validated thesis, real resources, and a clean slate into a growth system that works—and then hand it off cleanly so the company can scale.


This is a co\-founder–level role in practice, with accountability for outcomes—not hand\-offs.

**How This Works at Mechanism**
-------------------------------


Each company pairs:

* A **high\-caliber fractional CEO**, responsible for overall company leadership and removing obstacles
* A **Startup Growth Lead**, responsible for designing, executing, and scaling the growth engine
* A centralized Mechanism team providing engineering, design, data, automation, and operational leverage
* Our explicit goal is to **maximize your leverage**—so small, correct inputs produce outsized results.


Think rolling boulders downhill, not pushing them uphill.

**What You Own**
----------------


You are accountable for:

* Growth strategy and prioritization
* Channel discovery, testing, and validation
* Building a repeatable, profitable acquisition system
* Customer understanding and feedback loops
* Proving positive unit economics and a path to scale

  

You are **not** responsible for:

* Inventory management
* Cash management or P\&L ownership
* Customer support
* General operations


Those functions exist to support growth—not dilute it.

**What You’ll Do**
------------------

* Own growth end\-to\-end for a newly launched company, with profitability as the primary KPI
* Design and execute the growth strategy across acquisition, conversion, retention, and monetization
* Build and maintain a clear growth model defining assumptions, targets, and constraints
* Design fast, disciplined experiments to validate demand, channels, pricing, and positioning

 **Personally own or directly oversee:**

* Paid acquisition (especially Google Ads and Meta)
* Conversion rate optimization
* Landing pages and funnel testing
* Retention and lifecycle systems where relevant
* Scale what works, kill what doesn’t—quickly and decisively
* Partner closely with product, engineering, and design to translate growth insights into high\-leverage changes
* Participate in board meetings to share growth strategy, results, learnings, and blockers
* Document systems, playbooks, and learnings so they can be reused across future launches
* Leverage AI and automation to increase speed, clarity, and effectiveness
* Transition growth ownership to a long\-term team once the engine is stable and repeatable


The goal is to **launch, validate, scale, and transition** growth ownership in under 12 months—then move on to build the next company.

**Who This Is For**
-------------------


This role is ideal if you:

* Are a high\-ownership growth operator with founder\-level instincts
* Thrive in early\-stage ambiguity but demand real resources and leverage
* Move extremely fast without sacrificing rigor
* Care deeply about unit economics and profitability
* Want co\-founder impact without being diluted by non\-growth execution
* Want to work alongside some of the strongest operators of your career


This is not a traditional “Head of Growth” role inside an existing company. It is a chance to **repeatedly build the growth foundations of companies designed to matter**, inside a system optimized for speed, clarity, and compounding leverage.

**Requirements**
----------------

* 5\+ years building and scaling growth engines in early\-stage companies
* Deep hands\-on experience with Google Ads, Meta Ads, and CRO
* Strong first\-principles and systems thinking
* High\-speed, high\-quality execution under ambiguity
* Strong written and verbal communication
* Comfort leveraging AI, automation, and modern growth tooling

**Logistics**
-------------

* Full\-time, US\-based, fully remote
* Significant overlap with US ET required
* High\-commitment role by design

------------------

Stroudinc and Onda are sister eCommerce businesses, founded to serve the same type of operator from two complementary angles: strategy and execution.


Stroudinc is a focused eCommerce consultancy that works directly with founders and leadership teams to diagnose what’s limiting growth, pressure\-test strategy, and define a clear, actionable roadmap across acquisition, marketing, and operations.


Onda is a full\-service eCommerce marketing agency led by Chris and a team of senior Fractional CMOs. Onda partners with brands that want experienced, operator\-level leadership and hands\-on execution across performance marketing and growth.


We’re hiring a Senior Sales Executive to own high\-intent, consultative sales conversations across both brands. This is a call\-forward role where you’ll speak directly with eCommerce founders and senior marketing leaders, uncover real business problems, and close new engagements. You’ll be trusted to represent both brands with founder\-level judgment and credibility in every conversation.


This role is designed for an experienced seller who has already proven they can close complex eCommerce marketing deals, earn trust quickly with operators, and sell based on insight rather than tactics alone.


Location: 100% Remote — U.S. or Canada preferred; South Africa considered (must have reliable overlap with North American business hours)
  

Reporting to: Head of Sales / Revenue Lead
  

Type: Full\-time (Contract or Employee, depending on location)

* Qualify opportunities rigorously across budget, authority, timing, and fit—protecting delivery teams from poor\-fit clients.
* Close new business consistently against provided inbound and warm opportunities (no cold prospecting or outbound hunting required)
* Clearly communicate scope, value, and expectations to ensure strong handoffs to consulting and delivery teams
* Partner closely with founders, VP of Sales, and senior operators to refine positioning, messaging, and offer clarity based on real market feedback.
* Maintain accurate deal status and notes in the CRM, with sales operations and coordination handled by internal support teams
* Participate in continuous improvement of the sales process, including discovery frameworks, qualification standards, and objection handling
* Represent both brands with professionalism, credibility, and sound judgment in every client interaction

This role is intentionally focused on selling—lead generation, scheduling, proposals, and backend coordination are handled by internal teams so you can spend the majority of your time on high\-quality conversations and closing.  

  

  



**Who You Are**
---------------

* 3\-5\+ years of experience in a closing role selling eCommerce marketing services (agency) and/or eCommerce marketing technology (MarTech / SaaS)

=======================


Fractional AI builds bespoke GenAI software to transform businesses. We work with customers like Zapier, Airbyte, and Change.org to build their high\-impact gen AI applications.


Every C\-suite in the country is trying to bridge the gap between AI in theory and AI in practice. We close this gap with exceptional engineering talent and custom end\-to\-end AI builds (see some of our case studies to learn more).


We’re profitable, scaling fast, and focused on solving the hardest problems in applied AI.

**About the role**
==================


Our customers come to us with ambitious, often fuzzy goals—*make content moderation faster*, *customer service cheaper and better*, *unlock new integrations*, *automate the workflows no one else can touch*.


Your job is to turn those goals into AI\-powered solutions that actually work in the real world—and to own the journey from first conversation live system real business impact.


This is a **forward\-deployed, full\-stack customer role**:

* Part **engagement manager** (you’re the primary face of Fractional to the client)
* Part **product manager** (you decide what we build and why)
* Part **delivery/program manager** (you run the execution motion end\-to\-end)
* Part **“do whatever it takes” operator** (you jump into the gaps to keep things moving)

**What you’ll do:**
===================

**Own the customer relationship end\-to\-end**

* Act as the customer’s day\-to\-day strategic partner and primary point of contact.
* Join early\-stage calls, run discovery, synthesize feedback, and keep customers aligned on what we’re building and why.
* Build trusted relationships across all levels of an organization, setting clear expectations and being candid about tradeoffs.

**Shape what we build and why**

* Define product builds, refine and sequence scope, and identify the highest\-leverage use cases.
* Translate ambiguous business problems into crisp problem statements, user journeys, and success metrics.
* Work with customers to define what “success” actually means—then design experiments, KPIs, and dashboards to prove it.

**Turn messy problems into shipped solutions**

* Translate ambiguous customer needs into clear requirements, PRDs, and plans for engineers.
* Shape workflows, edge cases, evaluation criteria, and deployment success metrics for AI\-powered systems.
* Sit in the loop with engineering: prioritization, tradeoffs, testing, evals, and launches.

**Drive execution across multiple AI builds**

* Run the day\-to\-day execution rhythm: stand\-ups, planning, check\-ins, risk/issue tracking, and runway management.
* Coordinate between customers, engineers, designers, and other Fractional teammates to keep projects unblocked and moving.
* Own timelines and delivery quality—getting projects across the finish line consistently and calmly, even when things change late.

**Help create demand, not just fulfill it**

* Jump on early, messy conversations where the “project” is still a vague idea.
* Help founders and sales tease out real pain, sketch solution approaches live, and scope engagements that we can actually deliver.
* Spot expansion opportunities and help turn successful deployments into broader, long\-term partnerships.

**Drive adoption and long\-term impact**

* Work with client teams on rollout, enablement, and change management—so the systems you build actually get used.
* Monitor performance, gather qualitative and quantitative feedback, and push for improvements where they matter most.
* Bring back insights and patterns that inform Fractional’s internal playbooks, tooling, and product direction.

**Bring judgment and clarity**

* When requirements are fuzzy, data is messy, or customers change course, you’ll break the problem down and guide everyone toward the highest\-impact solution.
* Be the person in the room who can say, “Here’s what we’re actually trying to do, here’s what we know, here’s the plan.”

**What you bring:**
===================

**Customer\-facing, high\-stakes experience**

* You’ve led projects where customers were under pressure, stakeholders weren’t aligned, and the path wasn’t obvious.
* You’re comfortable pushing back, reframing the problem, and holding the line on quality.

**Real product \& delivery experience**

* You’ve built and shipped products or services in partnership with engineers and designers—ideally across multiple cycles.
* You know how to run an execution rhythm (stand\-ups, planning, tracking, retros) without turning it into process theater.

**Structured problem\-solving and communication**

* You ask good questions, structure chaos, and turn ambiguity into a plan.
* You can go from whiteboarding with execs to writing a crisp doc for engineers without losing the plot.

**Bias for action and ownership**

* You roll up your sleeves and make things happen, whether that’s writing a scrappy SQL query, drafting a support playbook, or jumping into a last\-minute exec demo.

**Experience range**

* Typically 4–8 years in product, consulting, implementations, or any role where execution and customer trust mattered more than your job title. (We care more about what you’ve done than the exact label on your resume.)

**Comfort with ambiguity and intensity**

* You like high\-energy environments, messy problems, and “we haven’t done this before” projects.
* You can juggle multiple customers, keep priorities straight, and make good calls with incomplete information.

**AI curiosity, not AI dogma**

* You don’t need deep AI expertise on day one. You do need curiosity, strong reasoning, and a desire to learn fast—and to overuse AI in your own workflow.

**In your first 30 days, you might...**
=======================================

* Take full ownership of a live customer project and become their primary point of contact.
* Run discovery sessions and turn a fuzzy problem into a clear plan for engineers, complete with success metrics and a first milestone.
* Lead regular client meetings, track progress, and keep delivery smooth—flagging risks early and offering options instead of surprises.
* Guide high\-stakes moments—like demoing a prototype to a CTO or VP, handling sharp questions, and steering the conversation toward outcomes.
* Kick off a second project in a totally different industry, learning new workflows on the fly.
* Overuse AI: from note\-taking and research to drafting docs and testing prototypes.
* Plug into Fractional’s rhythm—from Project Lunch \& Learns to our monthly Happy Hour—and start shaping how we deliver applied AI, not just what we deliver.

**Why you should (and shouldn’t) join us**
==========================================


We believe in transparency and know joining a company is a big decision. We’re not the best fit for everyone and try to be clear on what we are and what we’re not so you make the choice that’s right for you.

*Why join Fractional?*

* A front\-row seat to the AI revolution: In one year at Fractional AI, you will have led many 0\-to\-1 gen AI builds for leading companies, quickly becoming an expert in applied AI.
* A huge and growing problem space: Getting gen AI into production is the challenge of our time – with legacy consulting firms already driving several billion dollars per year on genAI advising revenue. Most offerings on the market don’t meet the need – they are one size fits all product solutions or advising services without the engineering team to deliver. We offer the engineering talent to meet the need.
* A team of veteran founders: The team is built from multi\-time founders and co\-founded by Travis May, former CEO of LiveRamp and founder \+ former CEO of Datavant.

*Why you shouldn't join?*

* We are unapologetically building an engineering\-first culture. This is how we build the team to meet the moment. We overdeliver for our clients by crafting a culture that enables the best engineers to thrive.
* We are a professional services business. Building for clients and their customers is distinctly different from building for your own product’s customer or users. It’s not for everyone.
* We are in\-person. We’re committed to building an in\-person team in our San Francisco and NYC offices. This enables us to learn faster together. For the right person, this is a pro, not a con, but it’s non\-negotiable.

=======================


Fractional AI builds bespoke gen AI software to transform businesses.


Every C\-suite in the country is trying to bridge the gap between AI in theory and AI in practice. We close this gap with exceptional engineering talent and custom end\-to\-end AI builds (see some of our case studies to learn more).


By joining Fractional AI, you’re stepping onto a San Francisco, NYC, and Dubai\-based team working on gen AI projects for top companies from the comfort of an engineering\-first startup.


**About the Role**
==================


Joining Fractional AI as an AI Engineer, you’ll play a leading role in building and shipping AI applications for our customers \- from understanding customer needs to deploying solutions in their environments \- all while shaping our engineering and broader Fractional culture for the next 100\+ engineers.


By the time you’ve completed your second project, you’ll have shipped LLM applications across more companies and use cases than the vast majority of AI engineers in the world.

**What you bring to the table:**
================================

* You write exceptional code \+ deeply care about the craft of coding (4\+ years of experience): you build elegant, production\-ready code; you have strong proficiency across multiple programming languages
* You have a track record building with Large Language Models: you have experience building scalable applications with LLMs, using frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.
* You love solving hard, new problems: you are comfortable self\-teaching, asking “why?,” and experimenting to solve problems you haven’t seen before
* You are ‘start\-up ready’: you jump in without instruction, embrace a ‘no job too big, no job too small’ mindset, and want to shape strategy and culture
* You are comfortable talking with customers: you deeply care about the customer and skillfully navigate customer conversations to ensure what we’re building meets their needs
* You are a great teammate: you are comfortable helping others (and asking for help), you champion integrity in everything, and want to build a one\-in\-a\-career culture of personal growth

**What you'll do:**
===================

* Design and develop custom AI solutions tailored to the unique needs of our customers, ensuring seamless integration and scalability
* Partner with a high\-caliber team across the full project lifestyle, from requirements gathering, to prototyping, system design, coding, testing, deployment, and support
* Actively shape our engineering and broader company culture \- from how we learn, to how we hire, to how we celebrate \- you’ll shape how we make Fractional a place we all love working

**Our tech stack:**
===================

* We’re generally tech stack agnostic \- we work in our customers’ environments and code bases. A lot, but definitely not all, of our work is in python.
* After working at Fractional AI for a few years, you’ll be an expert at using the various foundational models, building with tools like Langchain/Langsmith, and various other tools and frameworks (e.g., OpenPipe, Pinecone, ChromaDB).

**A day in the life:**
======================

* You're on a ""Project Team"" designed for that client's high\-impact AI need\- it may be automating a call center with AI phone agents or building an AI content moderation system – each project is different
* You’ll dive into one of the higher priority items for the morning (say building out an evals suite). You have a weekly standup with the customer (the CTO at the client) to chat through tradeoffs, progress, and timeline.
* You join team lunch (which doubles as the Fractional AI cross\-project standup) to hear about different projects we’re working on … the lunch will turn into a lively debate about Weights and Biases v. Braintrust capabilities.
* You’ll have some solo heads down time to continuing jamming on the high priority pieces for that print.
* Maybe you join a prospective customer call to share your perspective on what’s technically feasible on that potential project.

**Who you'll work with:**
=========================

* This role will collaborate closely with Eddie, our Co\-Founder and CTO.
* You’ll work very closely with other engineers on the team \- most project teams consist of 2\-5 engineers and a PM.
* You’ll also spend a lot of time partnering with our CEO, Chris, and Chairman, Travis.

**Why you should (and shouldn’t) join us**
==========================================


We’re big believers in transparency and know joining a company is a big decision. We’re not the best fit for everyone and try to be clear on what we are and what we’re not so you make the choice that’s right for you.

**Why join Fractional?**
------------------------

* **Build on the forefront of applied AI:** You’ll have a front row seat to how the world’s leading companies are actually deploying AI solutions. By the time you’ve completed your second project, you’ll have shipped LLM applications across more companies and use cases than the vast majority of AI engineers in the world.
* **Solve big, real problems:** Companies come to us when they can’t solve some of their biggest problems themselves. For you, that means learning everyday, never getting bored, and working across a range of industries, customers, and products.
* **Learn with and from the best in person:** We're a team of senior engineers (some former founders, some former engineering leaders) who only want to work on high\-impact projects. Working elbow to elbow in our San Francisco, NYC, or Dubai offices means things like team lunches, quick brainstorming, and the right amount of banter.

**Why shouldn't you join Fractional?**
--------------------------------------

* **Preference for just speed or quality:** We love hacking things together for a proof of concept but ultimately our code will be put into production in our customers’ environments \- you need to enjoy balancing elegance and expediency.
* **Predictability is important to you:** You’ll be working across customers, programming languages, industries and projects, which means you won’t be becoming an expert in the same product suite or serving the same user day after day.
* **Customers aren’t your thing:** You’ll spend most of your time coding but will be closer to the customer than in most engineering roles. You’ll frequently interact with engineers from the customer’s team to ask questions and problem solve. A deep understanding and appreciation of the customer is crucial.

**About Vet At Your Door:**

Vet At Your Door (VAYD) is a veterinarian\-owned and operated house call practice serving communities across Maine since 2015\. Founded on the belief that the best care happens at home, we bring high\-quality, compassionate veterinary medicine directly to our clients’ doors.

We are transforming from à la carte veterinary care to a membership\-based care operating system as a core pillar of a 10× revenue growth plan over the next 2\.5 years, with the goal of becoming the first national employee\-owned (ESOP) veterinary practice by 2028\.

**About The Role:**

**What**: This is anExecutive Operator position in a High\-Growth Healthcare Services company.

**Where:** While this is a mostly remote role, we prefer it if you are located in the Northeast and can travel to our headquarters in Brunswick, Maine as needed.

**Type:** This can be fractional or a full time employee.

**Reports to:** CEO

**Start:** Immediate

**Your Mission:**This is not a typical marketing role focused on advertising and messaging. Rather, it is about rebuilding how care is delivered, chosen, and experienced.

Your mission is to make membership the obvious, frictionless default for how clients engage with Vet At Your Door, by owning the end\-to\-end systems that drive adoption, retention, and long\-term value.

So, if you thrive in ambiguity, high stakes, and building systems that scale nationally, keep reading!

**What You Will Own:** 

You will own the end\-to\-end membership transformation, including:

* Designing membership as the default care model, not an add\-on.
* Working with our CTO and Operations team to re\-architect intake, scheduling, visit flow, follow\-up, and billing to support membership.
* Creating a behavioral conversion system (defaults, timing, friction removal), not a sales funnel.
* Defining how and when à la carte care is constrained and sunset (except for euthanasia \- we will always do this as a pay\-as\-you\-go service).
* Building a repeatable, scalable membership playbook for national expansion.
* Ensuring the system supports clinical excellence, trust, and long\-term relationships.
* Partnering with clinical, operations, and tech leaders to execute fast while considering revenue, reputation, and staff morale.
* Your main KPI is patient membership conversion; current clients and new clients.

**The Background We’re Looking For:**

You have already done something like this, ideally with:

* Healthcare, veterinary, concierge human medicine, home health, dental, or behavioral health for a business with legacy customers.
* A real transition away from à la carte or transactional pricing.

**Traits That Will Make You Successful In This Role:**

* You have a thorough understanding of the customer mindset.
* You also understand and work well with tech and operations.
* You operate calmly under pressure.
* You have a bias toward action over perfection.
* You are comfortable making consequential decisions with imperfect information, while actively managing risk and course\-correcting quickly.

**What We Offer:**

* Competitive executive compensation.
* Performance\-based upside.
* Structured long\-term rewards aligned with company growth
* Benefits \- We offer employees working 32\+ hours per week a well\-rounded benefits package designed to support you both professionally and personally.

**Interested In Learning More?** Please email Lisa Wright, our VP of Talent, at lwright@vetatyourdoor.com.

Malloy Industries connects B2B CEOs (typically $1M–$50M revenue, 10–100 employees) with vetted fractional executives who help bring structure to chaos. We’re known for being relentlessly generous, vulnerably trustworthy, enthusiastically fun, independently productive, and flexibly learning—and we take client outcomes seriously.

We’re expanding our Fractional Executive Network and are looking for experienced Fractional COOs / Directors of Operations to join our roster for potential client collaborations.

Important: This is NOT a full\-time job

Malloy Industries is building our Fractional Executive Roster. This posting is for experienced operations leaders who want to be considered for future fractional client engagements. If you’re looking for a W\-2, full\-time internal role, this won’t be the right fit.

**The Opportunity (Fractional / Contract)**  
As a fractional COO / Director of Operations in our roster, you may be matched with growth\-stage clients who need operational leadership—often 10–20 hours/week—to build systems, cadence, accountability, and execution muscle.

While we can’t guarantee a specific volume of client work, members join because we invest in their success with meaningful support and a strong matching process.

**What You’ll Do (Director of Ops / Fractional COO level)**  
You’ll operate as a senior operator for founder\-led companies—owning outcomes, not task lists. Depending on the client, you may:

* Lead operational strategy \+ execution across functions (Sales, Marketing, Delivery, Finance, People Ops)
* Build and run an operating cadence: weekly leadership meetings, KPI dashboards/scoreboards, quarterly priorities, action tracking
* Create role clarity \+ accountability (DRI ownership, meeting hygiene, decision rights, escalation paths)
* Design and implement core business systems: SOPs, workflows, handoffs, documentation
* Drive cross\-functional project management for high\-impact initiatives (process redesign, onboarding improvements, tool rollouts)
* Improve capacity planning and resource allocation (what gets done, by whom, and when)
* Partner directly with the CEO to translate strategy into execution and keep priorities on track

**Who This Is For (and who it’s not)**  
This is a fit if you’ve been responsible for making the business run, not just supporting someone who does. This roster is specifically for senior operations leaders who have owned operating systems, cross\-functional execution, and business outcomes.

**This is NOT an Executive Assistant / Administrative Assistant role.**

**Must\-haves**

* 8\+ years experience in operations with leadership scope (COO, Director of Operations, Head of Ops, Ops Lead with team/process ownership, etc.)
* Proven experience building and running operating rhythms (KPIs, weekly leadership meetings, quarterly priorities)
* Experience owning cross\-functional projects end\-to\-end (not just scheduling/follow\-ups)
* Ability to create process documentation \+ SOPs and drive adoption across a team
* Comfortable pushing back, clarifying priorities, and driving accountability with senior stakeholders
* US\-based; able to work remotely with US clients

**Strongly preferred**

* You’ve managed a team (Ops, PMs, admins, coordinators) and/or owned vendors/budgets
* You’ve supported a scaling company (10–100 employees) through growth/change

**Nice\-to\-haves**

* Prior fractional/consulting experience
* Experience implementing systems/tools
* Operations training/certification

**Benefits of Joining the Malloy Industries Network**

* Qualified lead pipeline delivering pre\-vetted, growth\-stage companies ready to collaborate
* Seamless back\-office support that handles all contracts, invoicing, and payment processing
* Active success partnership featuring weekly check\-ins to support you and monthly client reviews to protect your work
* Maximized earning potential by eliminating business development costs and friction

**Compensation**  
Compensation varies by client engagement and scope and will be discussed during the matching process.

**How to Apply**   
Applications are only accepted through our apply page and roundtable process. (required)

**Step 1: RSVP to “Explore Collaborations” (Executive Roundtable)**  
This is the essential first step. Once a month, we host a roundtable to personally meet potential members.

* You’ll introduce yourself and your services to our team
* We’ll explain our business model, the mutual referral agreement, and how we support our executives
* We decide together if there’s a mutual fit for collaboration

This is a conversation, not an interrogation.

**Step 2: Complete the Malloy Industries Member Application**  
Complete immediately after booking your roundtable session: https://www.malloyindustries.com/apply

Please take your time to provide detailed, thoughtful responses—especially for your **Value Prop**—because this is what we literally copy and paste to recommend you to potential clients.

BoxPower helps utilities, communities, and critical infrastructure deploy resilient, cost\-effective distributed energy systems. We combine planning/design software (EASI), turnkey hardware “kits,” and execution services (EPC \+ O\&M) to make DER deployments repeatable and scalable.

  

**The Role**



BoxPower is scaling from \~$20M toward $100M\+ in revenue. We need a VP of Business Operations to build and run the company operating system—the planning cadence, cross\-functional execution rhythm, internal controls, business systems, and people operations infrastructure that reduces fire drills and removes founder dependence.



You’ll lead the Head of People/HR and ensure people processes (hiring, onboarding, performance, leveling, comp administration, manager enablement) are embedded into a disciplined operating model.



This is a high impact “integrator” role: part operating model architect, part systems builder, part accountability driver.

  

**What You’ll Own**



1\) Company Operating System


* Design and run quarterly/annual planning, KPI/operating reviews, and decision forums
* Clarify ownership and decision rights (RACI/DRI), reduce ambiguity and escalations
* Drive meeting hygiene, priority discipline, and follow\-through


2\) Cross\-Functional Process \& Execution


* Standardize and improve critical workflows end\-to\-end (Sales Contract NTP Delivery O\&M)
* Identify recurring friction points and “fire drills,” run root\-cause fixes, and make changes stick
* Build lightweight program management where needed to drive adoption


3\) Business Systems \& Information Management


* Own internal systems strategy and adoption (ERP/HRIS/CRM/BI, ticketing, doc/knowledge systems)
* Ensure clean definitions and reporting across systems; stand up basic RevOps/BI capability as resourced
* Create a usable, owned knowledge base and file structure (fast retrieval, version control, clear owners)


4\) People Operations


* Lead the Head of People/HR; ensure scalable people processes and manager enablement
* Operationalize recruiting workflows, onboarding, performance management, leveling, compensation administration
* Embed values and leadership expectations into the “how we operate,” not posters on the wall


5\) Governance \& Internal Controls


* Implement delegation of authority and approval workflows (pricing, contract terms, change orders, major purchases, hiring approvals)
* Standardize templates and review processes with fractional GC/CFO
* Own corporate admin hygiene: licenses, registrations, bonding/insurance docs, compliance calendars
  


**What Success Looks Like (First 12 Months)**


* A clear operating cadence adopted company\-wide (planning, KPI reviews, issue management)
* 2–3 major workflows measurably improved (cycle time, quality, rework reduction) with owners \+ KPIs
* Fewer CEO/CFO “where is this / who owns this” escalations, less meeting load, more execution
* Systems adoption improves (CRM/ERP/HRIS hygiene, consistent reporting, reliable data)
* Executive team and Board view BoxPower as meaningfully more predictable and scale\-ready
  


**Who You Are**


* A builder/operator who has implemented operating systems in a scaling company (often in industrial, energy, EPC, hardware, or other execution\-heavy environments)
* Comfortable driving change across executives: you create clarity, alignment, and accountability without drama
* Strong at translating strategy into rhythms, processes, owners, dashboards, and behavior change
* Systems\-fluent: you can lead ERP/HRIS/CRM adoption and ensure people actually use the tools
* High judgment and discretion—trusted to handle sensitive people and organizational issues
  


**Qualifications**


* 10\+ years in BizOps / Company Ops / COO\-lite roles, with clear examples of systems/process adoption outcomes
* Track record implementing planning cadences, KPI operating reviews, and cross\-functional process fixes
* Experience leading or tightly partnering with HR/People Ops; ability to run people operations as an operating function
* Strong communication, structured thinking, and “get it done” execution

The Position



We are hiring a Head of Finance to be a strategic partner to the executive team and a thought leader across the company. This is not a back\-office accounting role. You will own the financial narrative of the business and help shape how we scale.

  

Reporting directly to the COO, you will be responsible for building the finance function end\-to\-end—spanning strategic finance, FP\&A, accounting oversight, cash management, and board/investor support—while operating with a high degree of autonomy and judgment.

  

We are not starting from scratch. We have a sound financial plan, a fractional controller, a monthly close process that works, and a full time finance team member who would report to you.

  

This role is ideal for someone who wants to help run the company, not just report on it.



What You'll Do


* **Be a Strategic Thought Partner**
+ Act as a trusted advisor to the COO, CEO, and leadership team on key business decisions, tradeoffs, and investments
+ Translate strategy into financial reality: what to prioritize, what to defer, and why
+ Develop a deep understanding of the unit economics, growth levers, and constraints of the business
* **Own Financial Planning \& Decision Support**
+ Lead annual planning, quarterly re\-forecasting, and long\-range financial modeling
+ Build and maintain models that connect revenue growth, hiring plans, product investments, and cash runway
+ Create clear, decision\-oriented dashboards and narratives for executives and the board
* **Build and Scale the Finance Function**
+ Own the finance operating model: what stays in\-house vs. outsourced, now and over time
+ Manage and develop the existing finance resources (fractional controller, part\-time bookkeeper, and FTE finance team member)
+ Continuously improve financial processes, controls, and systems without adding unnecessary bureaucracy
* **Own the Financial Story Externally**
+ Partner with leadership on board materials, investor updates, and fundraising readiness
+ Ensure financial reporting is accurate, timely, and credible as the company scales
+ Be the point person for auditors, tax advisors, and other external partners
* **Steward the Business**
+ Manage cash flow, runway, and risk with discipline and foresight
+ Ensure compliance with relevant financial and regulatory requirements
+ Bring a proactive, problem\-solving mindset to ambiguous or fast\-changing situations

  




What success Looks Like (12\-18 Months In)


* Leadership uses finance as a *decision engine*, not a reporting function
* The company has clear visibility into unit economics, burn, and growth tradeoffs
* Board and investor conversations are grounded, credible, and forward\-looking
* Finance operations scale smoothly with growth, without drama or heroics
* You are viewed internally as a business leader, not a service provider

  

Who You Are


* Investment banking experience required, private equity experience strongly preferred
* Experienced in strategic finance, FP\&A, or operating finance within a high\-growth environment
* A strategic thinker who is comfortable forming opinions and challenging assumptions
* Fluent in financial modeling and business storytelling—not just spreadsheets
* Comfortable operating in ambiguity and building structure where little exists
* Collaborative, low\-ego, and confident working with senior stakeholders
* Excited to help build—not just inherit—a finance function (even though, genuinely, you aren’t starting from scratch)

  

Why You'll Like Working Here



Join our growing team! Here at point.me we believe in taking care of our team, so that our team can take care of our customers. All employees are offered the following:

We are seeking a highly qualified Executive Director who will also serve as the Clinical Supervisor for a licensed Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment program in New Jersey. This dual\-role position carries ultimate responsibility for organizational leadership, regulatory compliance, and clinical oversight of substance use disorder services.  

This role is designed for a credentialed clinician with demonstrated executive capability.

**Business Development \& Strategic Partnerships Lead (Fractional)**



Black Fox Global is seeking a senior, fractional Business Development \&amp;  

Strategic Partnerships Lead to advance sustainable, values\-aligned  

revenue growth without compromising delivery quality, culture, or system  

health.



This role is structured as a 90–120 day pilot to assess whether focused,  

senior\-level business development capacity can convert strong inbound  

interest, long\-standing relationships, and market credibility into contracted,  

well\-aligned engagements. The role is additive to leadership\-led business  

development efforts and is evaluated on the quality and progression of  

owned opportunities, not sole responsibility for firm\-wide revenue.



The role prioritizes judgment over volume, with success demonstrated  

through disciplined advancement of a limited number of high\-fit  

opportunities, strength of relationships advanced, and tangible revenue  

momentum.



Black Fox Global primarily serves NGOs with approximately $1M–$10M in  

annual revenue, at a stage where the right strategic and fundraising  

support materially changes outcomes.



The ideal candidate brings senior credibility and direct outcomes  

responsibility in trust\-based environments, operates comfortably peer\-to\-  

peer with founders, executives, and funders, and advances conversations  

toward committed engagements with integrity and discernment.



Compensation includes a $5,000–$6,000 monthly retainer and a 3–7%  

performance\-based bonus tied to contracted revenue the individual  

materially advances.



This initial engagement also serves as a learning period. Where there is  

strong fit and mutual interest, insights may inform longer\-term continuity or  

succession considerations — optional, emergent, and never assumed.


**Full Description**


**Black Fox Global \| Business Development \& Strategic Partnerships Lead \|**  

**Fractional; Remote**



15 hours/week \| Fractional, remote role with an initial 90–120 day  

engagement designed to assess fit and inform potential next phases.  

Conference participation may be included.


**About Black Fox Global (BFG)**



Black Fox Global is a global fundraising firm that has partnered with NGOs,  

foundations, and mission\-driven organizations around the world for more  

than 12 years.



We support leaders by helping them mobilize resources, build durable  

funder relationships, and scale impact without compromising integrity,  

exhausting their teams, or relying on transactional fundraising tactics.


**Our work is known for:**


* Outcome\-driven partnerships that build durable, independent capacity for NGOs across regions and issue areas.
* Longstanding, trusted relationships across the funding and NGO ecosystem.
* Clear thinking, open knowledge\-sharing, and consistently strong results.


As the sector evolves, we are also investing in AI\-enabled tools and  

intelligent systems to strengthen fundraising expertise access, strategy,  

decision\-making, and long\-term sustainability.


**Why This Role Exists**



This new role exists to test whether focused, senior\-level business  

development capacity can unlock sustainable revenue without  

compromising delivery quality or culture. Black Fox Global benefits from  

consistent inbound interest, long\-standing relationships ready for  

reactivation, and a strong but under\-leveraged trusted presence across the impact ecosystem, all of which warrant intentional, senior\-level cultivation and follow\-through.



Beyond revenue outcomes, this initial engagement is designed to inform  

longer\-term leadership and founder succession planning, should there be  

mutual interest and demonstrated fit. Succession exploration is optional,  

emergent, and not implied as an expectation.


**Initial Engagement Focus (First 90–120 Days)**



The initial phase is designed to assess alignment, market signal, and  

tangible revenue momentum. While Black Fox Global does not pursue  

misaligned or pressured closing, business generation is a core expectation  

during this period.



Success is demonstrated by the ability to move qualified opportunities  

meaningfully forward, from opening doors, through trust\-based  

conversations, to committed, values\-aligned engagements, in ways that  

strengthen both revenue and reputation.



Recognizing that trust\-based NGO decision cycles vary, evaluation  

considers not only revenue outcomes, but also the progression and quality  

of owned opportunities, including movement toward decision, strength of  

relationships advanced, and alignment with delivery capacity.


**Areas of Responsibility \| Priority Outcomes**



This role is designed to be additive and complementary to existing  

business development efforts led by Black Fox Global leadership. While the  

Business Development \&amp; Strategic Partnerships Lead will own and  

advance a defined subset of priority opportunities, overall firm revenue  

generation is a shared responsibility across leadership.



Success in this role is assessed based on the quality and progression of  

created and owned opportunities, contribution to overall pipeline health,  

and alignment with delivery capacity. Responsibilities include:


* Re\-activate dormant relationships and advance them toward contracted engagement, with a primary focus on NGOs operating within Black Fox Global's core growth segment: Organizations with approximately $1M\-$10M in annual revenue, who are:


* Established enough to benefit meaningfully from systems,


 strategy, and relationship\-building  

* Still at a stage where the right support materially changes


 outcomes  

* Led by ambitious, mission\-driven leaders seeking greater


 clarity, confidence, and funder strategy  

* Ready to translate advisory and fundraising support into real,


 sustainable revenue growth
* Initiate and cultivate new, high\-quality conversations and


introductions, leveraging trusted networks and targeted sector  

engagement to convert aligned interest into qualified opportunities.
* Assess funder appetite and broader sector dynamics related to


capacity\-building, advisory, and fundraising support for organizations  

in this stage of growth.
* Advance select warm or well\-aligned opportunities through proposal,


decision, and contracted engagement.
* Leverage the Black Fox Global ecosystem, reputation, and


relationships to build a strong pipeline of NGO partners for whom this  

work is both timely and transformative.

In practice, this role prioritizes disciplined advancement of a select number  

of well\-aligned opportunities. Within the first 60 \- 90 days, the expectation is  

focused engagement across approximately 8 \- 10 priority opportunities that  

are actively moving toward decision or already contracted, alongside lighter  

stewardship of a broader set of warm and longer\-term relationships within  

the Black Fox Global / sector ecosystem.



Success in this role depends upon sound judgment about where to  

concentrate effort, how to pace trust\-based conversations, and when to  

advance, pause, or decline opportunities in service of sustainable growth  

and delivery quality.



Longer\-term stewardship, expanded scope, and deeper revenue ownership  

may be explored if this initial phase demonstrates both fit and results. More  

in the ‘Growth \&amp; Continuity’ section.


**Market Presence**



Every external interaction this person has serves as a quiet signal of who  

we are, how we lead, and what we stand for.


* Represent BFG with professionalism, discernment, and gravitas.
* Communicate our ethos of generosity and excellence through judgment and clarity.


**Technology\-Enabled Futures \& AI Curiosity**



AI fluency is not required for initial success in this role. However, curiosity  

about technology\-enabled futures will become increasingly relevant as  

Black Fox Global evolves. We are actively exploring the development of an  

AI\-enabled fundraising and strategy agent grounded in Black Fox Global’s  

methodology, ethics/ethos, and relational intelligence. Candidates who are  

excited by innovative ways to serve at scale will be especially well\-aligned.


**Collaboration with Founder \& Operations**



This role works in close collaboration with the Founder and Operations to  

ensure business development decisions are grounded in delivery reality,  

protect system health, and support long\-term sustainability.


* Work closely with the Founder and operational leadership in a spirit of partnership and shared accountability.
* Collaborate closely with Operations to ensure tight alignment from business development through delivery, including clear handoffs, shared expectations, and consistent client experience.
* Advance opportunities with a clear understanding of delivery capacity, system health, and operational constraints, ensuring what we promise externally can be delivered with excellence.
* Surface insights early to support sustainable planning, execution, and client success.

  


**Ideal Candidate**



This role is designed for someone who brings senior judgment, real closing  

responsibility, and calm authority to business development in trust\-based  

environments.


***You are likely:***


* A senior sales, partnerships, or fundraising leader who has held direct responsibility for advancing and closing contracted engagements.
* Someone who has operated in high\-stakes executive contexts within the impact, philanthropic, or NGO ecosystem, and is now seeking a portfolio\-style role that prioritizes meaning, discernment, and sustainability.
* Deeply experienced in trust\-based, relational environments, where progress is built through credibility, timing, and judgment rather than transactional pressure.
* Comfortable engaging NGO executives, funders, and institutional partners globally, and guiding conversations toward clear, values\-aligned commitments.
* A recognized and respected presence within leading global convening and networks shaping the social impact sector.
* Grounded in mission\-driven work and ""sacred sales"" or fundraising practices, with curiosity about how technology and AI\-enabled systems may responsibly support future impact.


***You bring:***


* A demonstrated track record of moving high\-value engagements from early trust\-building through decision, commitment, and contract.
* The ability to balance ambition with restraint, pursuing growth that strengthens systems, relationships, and reputation over time.
* A collaborative, partnership\-oriented approach that complements leadership teams.
* Strong judgment around what to pursue, and what to decline, in service of protecting team capacity and system health.


A demonstrated track record of moving high\-value engagements from early  

trust\-building through decision, commitment, and contract.  

The ability to balance ambition with restraint, pursuing growth that

**Culture \& How We Lead**



At Black Fox Global, leadership looks like:


* Generosity without self\-erasure.
* Direct, respectful communication grounded in care and accountability.
* Ambition in service of mission.
* Power held responsibly.
* We care deeply about trust, clarity, and system health.


**Growth \& Continuity**



For the right person, strong contribution may lead to expanded scope,  

elevated leadership designation, longer\-term continuity, profit participation  

and partner\-track exploration. Nothing is assumed or rushed; any evolution  

would be grounded in results, trust, and mutual fit.


**Compensation**



Compensation includes:


* A monthly retainer of $5,000–$6,000, based upon experience and


scope  

* A meaningful performance\-based bonus (3–7%) tied to contracted


revenue that the individual materially advances

The performance bonus is designed to:


* Reward real revenue outcomes, not activity or volume
* Align incentives with values\-led, sustainable growth
* Support fair attribution, including co\-selling with leadership
* Preserve delivery quality, system health, and long\-term trust


Bonus eligibility reflects material contribution to opportunities advanced from early engagement through decision and contracted commitment, whether independently or in partnership with Black Fox Global leadership.



This structure applies to the initial scope of work for the 90–120 day  

engagement.


**Equal Opportunity \& Inclusive Culture**



At Black Fox Global, we are committed to building a culture of belonging  

that provides opportunities for all qualified individuals. We believe a work  

environment that embraces and incorporates diverse strengths,  

backgrounds, and viewpoints makes us stronger and more effective in  

realizing our mission to advance meaningful social impact. We welcome  

candidates who share our commitment to equity, collaboration, and  

generosity, and we encourage applications from people of all races,  

ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, abilities, ages, and experiences.
