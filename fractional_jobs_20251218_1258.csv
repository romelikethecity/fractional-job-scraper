Escalon Services is a Business Process Management (BPM) company that provides Essential Business Services (EBS) through a tech\-enabled platform to small\- and medium\-sized businesses (SMBs) and startups. The Company enables its clients to spend less time on ""back office"" functions and provides the value and insight that enables clients to spend more time focusing on delivering value and moving their businesses forward. With a US\-based remote workforce and global delivery team in India, Escalon’s solution fills a widening service gap in the SMB market, underpinned by (i) increasing demand for quality insights in an increasingly competitive marketplace (ii) decreasing supply of CPAs and quality in\-house talent and (iii) the cost frictions associated with scaling internal back\-office teams as businesses grow. For more information on Escalon: https://escalon.services/
Since founding, the company has executed both on an organic and M\&A strategy to expand service offerings and drive revenue expansion opportunity through cross\-sell/up\-sell. Before partnering with New Harbor Capital in late 2022, Escalon completed two significant acquisitions which tripled the revenue of the company and expanded the FinOps capabilities of the platform. Continued corporate development is a key value driver for the business going forward, with a highly fragmented market of service providers, often individually unable to scale due to lack of technology\-enablement and offshore capabilities.
In late 2022, New Harbor Capital made a growth equity investment in Escalon Services.

Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) \& Cultural Officer

**Quentasia Studios**

Quentasia Studios is building a new model for premium, inclusive storytelling—one that recognizes audience, culture, and narrative as strategic assets, not afterthoughts. As we prepare to scale into a multi\-slate entertainment studio, we are seeking a **Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) \& Cultural Officer** who can translate mission into momentum and meaning into market impact.

This role is for a leader who understands that marketing is not just amplification—it is **architecture**: shaping how audiences find us, how partners understand us, and how culture experiences our work.

Why This Role Matters

The CMO \& Cultural Officer will play a defining role in how Quentasia is perceived, trusted, and embraced.

This role will directly influence:

* How Quentasia’s identity is articulated and protected
* How audiences discover and connect with our stories
* How cultural relevance translates into commercial value
* How partners, sponsors, and investors understand our market position

This is an opportunity to help architect the public\-facing voice of a studio that treats culture as infrastructure and audience trust as capital.

Key ResponsibilitiesBrand Leadership \& Narrative Stewardship

* Define and steward Quentasia’s brand narrative across studio, slate, and campaign levels.
* Ensure that storytelling, positioning, and messaging reflect Quentasia’s values, cultural commitments, and long\-term vision.
* Serve as a guardian of brand integrity as the company scales.

Audience Strategy \& Community Building

* Design and lead audience engagement strategies that prioritize authenticity, belonging, and long\-term loyalty.
* Build mission\-aligned communities across digital platforms, live events, and partnerships.
* Translate audience insight into actionable strategy across development, marketing, and distribution.

Integrated Marketing, PR \& Go\-to\-Market Strategy

* Lead integrated marketing and PR efforts spanning advertising, earned media, social, experiential, and platform partnerships.
* Guide go\-to\-market strategies for films, series, and campaigns in alignment with audience data and investor expectations.
* Balance cultural relevance with measurable performance outcomes.

Sponsorships, Partnerships \& Revenue Collaboration

* Collaborate with corporate sponsors, foundations, and cultural institutions to create aligned partnerships.
* Help shape sponsorship and brand integration strategies that respect creative integrity while driving revenue.
* Partner cross\-functionally to ensure marketing supports both commercial and mission\-driven goals.

Team Building \& Organizational Growth

* Build and lead a marketing organization that scales with the studio’s growth.
* Establish systems, workflows, and creative standards that enable consistency across multiple projects.
* Mentor and develop talent with an emphasis on inclusive leadership and creative excellence.

Ideal Candidate Profile

* Senior marketing leader with experience in entertainment, media, streaming, consumer brands, or cultural institutions.
* Demonstrated ability to build brands and communities with both cultural credibility and commercial impact.
* Proven success leading integrated campaigns and brand partnerships with clear ROI.
* Strong strategic instincts paired with hands\-on execution capability.
* Deep appreciation for culture, representation, and audience trust as strategic assets.
* Entrepreneurial mindset and comfort operating in a lean, evolving environment.
* A collaborative leader who can partner effectively with creative, finance, and executive leadership.

Engagement Structure

Because Quentasia is in a pre\-funding and early scaling phase, this role will begin as:

* Advisory or fractional, transitioning to full\-time as financing milestones are achieved
* Active participation in shaping studio identity, audience strategy, and leadership culture
* Advisory equity participation to reflect early belief and contribution
* Full compensation package (salary \+ equity) activated post\-funding

Candidates must be willing to sign a non\-binding **Letter of Intent (LOI)** confirming interest in being identified as part of Quentasia’s founding leadership circle.

The Opportunity

Most studios hire CMOs to promote content.

At Quentasia, you will help define how culture, audience, and commerce move together.

You will co\-create the identity and trajectory of a studio committed to storytelling that resonates deeply, travels widely, and endures—building trust with audiences while driving meaningful, sustainable growth.

Pay: $220,000\.00 \- $245,000\.00 per year

Application Question(s):

* Are you willing to begin this role in an advisory capacity, with compensation in the form of equity until funding is secured?
* Are you comfortable participating in early leadership discussions and senior\-team selection prior to full funding?
* Are you willing to sign a non\-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) confirming interest in a future leadership role and allowing us to present your name and resume to investors?
* Do you understand that this opportunity is pre\-funding and does not include salary or benefits at the initial advisory stage?

Our products are sold direct\-to\-consumer and are increasingly gaining traction with professional users such as landscapers, garden centers, and institutional buyers.

Our products can be viewed on the below websites:

www.smartcarts.com

www.infinitecedar.com

We are seeking an experienced, hands\-on operator to help us build and execute growth through pallet programs targeting landscapers, garden centers, equestrian supply stores, marinas, and instructional buying channels— without adding heavy overhead or management layers.

**Role Summary**

We are hiring a **fractional, part\-time Retail \& B2B Expansion Lead** to own and execute our expansion into:

* Regional garden center chains
* Landscaper / contractor programs
* Select institutional buyers (equestrian supply stores, marinas, parks, campuses, etc.)

This is a **builder role**, not a “strategy\-only” position. You will be responsible for developing the programs, opening accounts, and creating repeatable processes that allow Smart Carts to scale without the founder becoming a bottleneck.

The role is ideal for someone who has:

* Led retail or B2B expansion at a small\-to\-mid\-sized consumer or durable goods company
* Strong relationships or experience with independent garden centers, regional chains, or pro customers
* A bias toward execution, not bureaucracy

**Responsibilities**

**Retail Expansion**

* Identify and prioritize regional garden center chains and independent store groups
* Lead outreach, pitch meetings, and line reviews
* Develop pilot programs (10–50 store tests)
* Negotiate wholesale pricing, terms, and seasonal buy\-ins
* Coordinate forecasting and launch timelines with internal operations

**Landscaper \& Contractor Programs**

* Design and launch a landscaper / pro customer program
* Define pricing tiers, minimums, and reorder cadence
* Build a simple outbound and inbound sales process
* Close initial anchor accounts and create repeatable playbooks

**Program \& Process Development**

* Help define a small number of “program SKUs” optimized for B2B and retail
* Build simple tools: pitch decks, one\-pagers, pricing sheets, reorder workflows
* Create a clear handoff process so accounts can be managed efficiently over time

**Collaboration**

* Work directly with the founder and operations team
* Provide clear feedback on pricing, packaging, and product\-market fit
* Recommend where additional investment (inventory, tooling, marketing) is justified by demand

**What This Role Is** ***Not***

* Not a big\-box national account executive role (yet)
* Not a people\-management role
* Not a strategy\-only advisory role
* Not a commission\-only sales job

This is a **hands\-on growth operator role**.

**Time Commitment**

* **10–20 hours per week**, flexible
* Remote\-friendly with potential occasional travel for key accounts (if needed)

**Compensation Structure**

We are intentionally designing this role to be affordable, performance\-aligned, and motivating.

**Path to expanded role** as volume grows (optional, not promised or required)

**Ideal Background**

* 7\+ years in retail sales, wholesale, or B2B expansion
* Experience with:
* Garden centers, outdoor products, tools, equipment, equestrian product sales, or durable consumer goods
* Regional retail chains and/or pro customer sales
* Comfortable selling products in the $200–$600 retail price range
* Entrepreneurial mindset; comfortable working without a large support team

**Why This Role Is Attractive**

* Real ownership of a growth function at an inflection point
* Direct impact on company scale and strategy
* High autonomy
* No corporate politics
* Clear upside if programs succeed
* Opportunity to grow with the business if mutually desired

Pay: $3,000\.00 \- $5,000\.00 per month

Benefits:

* Work from home

Application Question(s):

* Please provide a short note on your experience with retail, garden centers, or B2B programs
* Please share examples of accounts or channels you have helped launch or scale
* Please confirm that you are interested in a fractional / part\-time role

Experience:

* Sales: 5 years (Required)

* Identify and engage decision\-makers at director level and above in marketing, revenue operations, and business development
* Qualify leads based on budget, authority, need, and timeline (BANT methodology)
