Growth Stage Controller: Build the Future of Finance at 2\-5 Hypergrowth Companies  


  

Embedded Teams \+ AI\-Enabled Intelligence  


  

In 24 months, you'll gain experience that would take 5\-7 years in a single\-company role. You'll serve as Controller for 2\-5 Series B\-C companies simultaneously—each with $20M\-$200M\+ in revenue, complex operations, and boards that demand excellence. You'll have the stability, resources and infrastructure of a 17 year old, 250\-person firm and you'll receive training in AI\-enabled financial intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else.  


  

This is foundational work—and it's the future.  


  

Nearly 17 years ago, we set out to find a better way to help the country's leading startups navigate the financial hazards that follow their first institutional funding.  


  

Today, Propeller's 250\+ full\-time professionals across three continents serve as the embedded finance and accounting partner to some of the most iconic emerging companies in Consumer, Technology, Blockchain, and Business Services.  


  

**Our embedded teams integrate seamlessly into client operations in multi\-year partnerships.** You'll attend weekly leadership meetings, participate in board prep, collaborate on strategic decisions, and have direct access to client CEOs and CFOs. This embedded positioning creates trust, access and influence that traditional providers never achieve.  


  

With our Financial Operating Platform—combining human judgment, precise accounting, data infrastructure, and AI\-enabled insight—**we transform finance from a back\-office function into the central nervous system of growth.**  

* Experience 2\-5 business models, GTM strategies, and leadership styles simultaneously
* Navigate wins and lessons\-learned across multiple companies and multiple stages
* Index clients against Propeller’s stage\-specific benchmarks to develop context for your instincts
* Regular interaction with Series B and C CFOs, CEOs, and stakeholders
* Present financials and strategic recommendations to sophisticated audiences
* Build relationships that become your professional network for life
* Hands\-on experience with Propeller's Intelligence Engine (PIE) and Data Lake (PDL)
* Learn to leverage systems and automation that transforms patterns into predictions
* Prepare for the future of finance while others react to it
* 17\-year\-old firm with strong balance sheet, 250 people and competitive compensation
* None of the startup risk, all of the upside learning
* Infrastructure and support that solo controllers rarely have
* Propeller alumni have gone on to earn CFO and controller roles at multiple unicorns and nine\-figure companies—**this role is a launchpad, not a landing pad**


  

Let's be direct about what it takes to succeed here:  


  

You'll juggle 2\-5 clients with different fiscal calendars, reporting requirements, board schedules, and growth stages. Without systematic thinking and disciplined execution, you'll drown. If you prefer improvisation over process, this isn't your role.  


  

You'll receive direct feedback frequently from senior controllers, CFO partners, and clients. Your ability to implement it quickly determines your success. If you need to be right more than you need to get better, this isn't your role.  


  

No lone wolves. You're building systems that outlive any individual engagement. Your insights become institutional knowledge. Your workflows help the next controller scale faster. If you hoard knowledge or prefer solo work, this isn't your role.  


  

Month\-end close means 2\-5 companies close simultaneously. Series B CFOs and boards expect precision, timeliness, and strategic perspective. If you prefer predictable 9\-5 rhythms, this isn't your role.  


  

Every client teaches something new. Technology platforms evolve. AI tools advance almost daily. Industry dynamics shift. If you prefer mastery through repetition over growth through challenge, this isn't your role.  


  

The Controller at Propeller builds systems that turn financial data into strategic foresight. You'll lead engagement teams to deliver month\-end closes with excellence while transforming traditional controller work—historically reactive and backward\-looking—into a proactive, AI\-enabled function that surfaces insights before problems arise.### **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Oversee engagement teams across U.S. and international personnel, delegating work to maximize efficiency
* Mentor and develop team members, actively supporting professional growth
* Manage utilization and client load to ensure team members are challenged, supported, and operating at optimal capacity
* Codify and share best practices, contributing to Propeller's institutional knowledge and platform intelligence
* Optimize margins and business unit efficiency, recognizing that Propeller's economics shift from hours billed to value delivered
* Proactively engage in Early Warning processes to surface issues before they escalate
* Support client pipeline development in collaboration with Business Development, CFO team, and Customer Experience
* Identify upsell and lifecycle extension opportunities by understanding client needs and demonstrating incremental value
* Partner with Customer Success to ensure deliverables meet Propeller's standards and drive client satisfaction
* Conduct periodic client file reviews to identify learning opportunities, develop best practices, and feed insights back into the platform
* Document workflows and surface repeatable intelligence that can be systematized through PropellerOS
* Drive high client satisfaction by delivering not just accurate financials, but timely, actionable insights
* Transform the monthly close call from backward\-looking reporting into strategic financial review powered by analytics and CFO perspective
* Develop scope and service offerings for potential Growth Stage clients
* Participate in all phases of the client conversion cycle: scoping, pitch, and SOW development
* Act as a strategic partner to executive teams, helping them navigate financial and operational complexity
* **Master's Degree or CPA required**
* **7\+ years in accounting/finance** with at least 3 years at companies or serving clients in the $10M\-$100M revenue range
* **Multi\-client or consulting background strongly preferred** (Big 4, boutique accounting firm, fractional CFO services, or similar)
* Demonstrated ability to **build processes from scratch**—not just follow them
* Cross\-functional experience developing processes around financial reporting and operational workflows
* Previous experience with Series B and Series C companies
* Strong understanding of how operational and business changes impact financial reporting
* Experience with investor diligence and audit preparedness
* Quickbooks


  

Consumer:  

  

  

* In\-depth understanding of inventory flow and cost accounting
* Experience with DTC and wholesale channels
* Strong knowledge of ASC 606 and revenue recognition
* Familiarity with sales tax implications and obligations
* Ability to distinguish between COGS and Opex

  

  

  

  

Enterprise/Technology:  

  

  

* Experience with revenue waterfalls and deferred revenue
* Solid understanding of ASC 606 and revenue recognition
* Familiarity with sales tax obligations
* Ability to identify capitalizable costs and correctly allocate to COGS or Opex
* Systems thinking: ability to see patterns, codify intelligence, and contribute to scalable, repeatable processes
* Comfort with ambiguity and change: Propeller is building the future of professional services, and this role requires adaptability, curiosity, and willingness to pioneer new approaches
* Technical aptitude: experience with modern tools like Claude Code, Databricks, Looker, N8N, or similar platforms

We're hiring a **Sr. Business Development Rep (Investor Relations)!**


* **Flexible Title:** Can tailor to reflect your skills \& experience.
* **Flexible Time:** Can do full\-time, part\-time, side\-gig (off\-hours), or fractional (contract).
* **Flexible Commitment:** Can do short\-term, long\-term, or intermittent.


**Why so flexible?** We're a FUNDED startup racing to launch end of Q1 2026\. That gives us just 3 months to stack features while raising additional working capital. Feel free to jump in, help us ship, then bounce \>\> or stick around. A successful launch translates into lots of permanent jobs for those that want them. We're also interested in long term ""side gig"" relationships, if that's what you're into \- in our experience, a few expert hours often beat full\-time learning\-curve hours.


### **About Us**


We're a credible, **funded**, remote\-first startup led by a serial \[technical] founder, and backed by a 20\-person team. The product is live in private alpha.


Learn more about our founder, team, and comp structures at **list\-lab.org**.


### **About The Role**

Up to **$300,000** max total compensation in Tier 1 cities; cash and equity components to be negotiated (amount reflects combined cash and equity components).

* You've asked for referrals on every single call — no exceptions
* You've flipped more than a few qualified leads to the Founder, for pitch and negotiation
* You've established a sustainable daily/weekly rhythm


### **What You Won't Do**


* **Pitch or sell the investment opportunity** — that's the Founder's job
* **Negotiate terms** — you qualify and warm up leads, then hand off for the close
* Go it alone — you'll have scripts, systems, and support to get started


### **What You'll Do**


* Work a structured referral tree to identify potential accredited investors (high\-earning professionals like executives, doctors, lawyers, engineers, or anyone with $200K\+ income or $1M\+ net worth)
* Conduct outreach to warm up leads via calls, emails, and LinkedIn
* Qualify leads and nurture qualified prospects through the process of watching our presentation
