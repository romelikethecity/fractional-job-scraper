Level10 CFO is a new firm for the new economy, offering a fresh take on outsourced CFO advisory and accounting services. We lead with an advisory first approach on all client engagements, whether that be for a start\-up company needing bookkeeping and some help with prospective financials for an investor deck; or a growth middle market company needing a CFO to help with strategic financial planning and a controller to bring controls and efficiency to its transactional accounting environment. We promote the use of EOS® (The  
Entrepreneurial Operating System...ask us later!) but don’t demand it of our clients, but it’s constructs are woven into how we engage and drive value for our clients. We live these core values:

* Our clients’ interests always come first.
* We brave the crucial conversations.
* We embrace technology.
* We actively challenge the status quo.
* We like to laugh (even at ourselves!).

**Summary** 

The Chief Financial Officer advisor must present as a self\-assured (but not cocky) consultant to the organization who can establish credibility, trust, and rapport quickly, both with leadership and any staff under direction. An ability to think strategically, speak truth to the client while also managing the relationships, and clearly organize priorities around the opportunities and risks in front of the client, both near and far, are essential for success in the role. Each day should start with the question, “How can leave the client better off than I found them?”

The CFO is also expected to contribute to the evolution and growth of Level10 CFO, including but not limited to our process, procedure, biz development, technical maturity, and general enjoyment of coming to work each day.

**Experience**

* Been to a few rodeos. Enjoyed a couple rides up and down the business roller coaster from an executive level. Have the scars to prove it.
* Been the right\-hand man, the consigliere to the CEO
* Mix of start\-up and mid\-market CFO, Controller, or like senior leadership work history ideal
* Experience in consulting and/or fractional work a bonus
* Capital raising and M\&A
* Played well with investor relations (VC, PE, Family Office, etc) and Boards of Directors relations
* Experience in technology/software and/or services organizations, especially agency model businesses.

**Skills** 

* Diplomacy
* Presentation skills, especially the numbers
* Keen financial analysis chops (i.e. a good BS detector)
* Demonstrable ability to adapt new technology
* Black belt in Excel/Google Sheets
* Tell a joke
* P.S. knowing GAAP and preparing a budget are table stakes

**Education** 

* BA/BS Degree in Accounting, Finance or related major
* CPA certification preferred
* If you have an MBA we won’t hold it against you

**Working Conditions** 

* This is a fully remote position. Work may require occasional weekend and/or evening work.

iota Biosciences, a wholly owned subsidiary of Astellas Pharma US, is advancing a new class of bioelectronic medicines through the development of fully implantable Class III medical devices. Our proprietary technologies open therapeutic and diagnostic possibilities not previously accessible to clinicians.  

  

Together with Astellas, we are committed to patient\-centric design, scientific and engineering excellence, and cross\-functional teamwork. These principles guide us in bringing transformative, first\-of\-its\-kind technologies into the clinic and closer to patients.

**About the Role**


iota is looking for a hands\-on finance leader who thrives in early\-stage environments and wants to build. This role is ideal for a senior staff accountant or early FP\&A professional who has a strong foundation in accounting but also wants to step into broader ownership of budgeting, burn\-rate tracking, process creation, and day\-to\-day financial operations.


You will be responsible for the day\-to\-day finance function, working closely with our fractional CFO and leadership team to establish the systems, processes, and financial discipline needed to scale a new venture. This is a highly visible, cross\-functional role with a real opportunity to shape how the company grows.

**What You’ll Do**


Financial Operations \& Accounting

* Oversee day\-to\-day accounting operations, including AP, month\-end close, reconciliations, and journal entries.
* Partner with external accounting and PEO teams to ensure accurate payroll, benefits, payroll tax processes and day\-to\-day accounting.
* Maintain the general ledger and ensure compliance with US GAAP.
* Support monthly, quarterly, and annual financial statements; prepare flux analysis; prepare schedules for audits and reviews.
* Manage the company’s use tax compliance, including preparing, documenting, and filing periodic returns. Work with the tax firm to support additional filings such as business property tax and franchise tax.


Budgeting, Forecasting \& Reporting

* Build and manage budgets in partnership with department leads and the fractional CFO; provide real\-time visibility into actuals vs. budget.
* Track and forecast burn rate, headcount costs, vendor spend, and runway—proactively flagging risks and insights.
* Develop dashboards and reporting that help leadership make informed decisions.


Systems, Processes \& Internal Controls

* Implement early financial systems, tools, and scalable processes (e.g., expense management, purchasing flows, cost tracking).
* Create simple but effective internal controls appropriate for an early\-stage company.
* Lead vendor onboarding and contract tracking; partner with legal and operations teams as needed.
* Creating and updating expense and travel policies and maintaining internal compliance.


Cross\-Functional Support

* Work closely with R\&D, Clinical, Operations, and HR to align finance with business needs.
* Help model scenarios for hiring, lab expansion, grants, capital planning, and investment decisions.
* Support board reporting, investor updates, and fundraising preparation.

**Who You Are**

* 5–8 years of accounting experience (startup or high\-growth environment strongly preferred).
* Strong understanding of US GAAP with hands\-on accounting capability—but also excited to expand into FP\&A.
* Scrappy, detail\-oriented, and comfortable wearing many hats—this role spans accounting, operations, and finance strategy.
* Someone who wants to *own* the finance function day\-to\-day, not just support it.
* Comfortable with ambiguity, building processes from scratch, and creating structure where none exists.
* Experience with finance systems; QuickBooks and Ramp a plus.

**Why This Role Is Exciting**

* You’ll be joining at the formation stage of a new, well\-funded company—your work will directly influence how the company grows.
* You’ll partner closely with experienced leaders (CEO, COO, fractional CFO) and gain exposure to strategic decision\-making.
* You’ll build foundational systems from the ground up, not inherit legacy processes.
* Clear growth path into Finance Manager or Controller as the company scales.

Growth Stage Controller: Build the Future of Finance at 2\-5 Hypergrowth Companies  


  

Embedded Teams \+ AI\-Enabled Intelligence  


  

In 24 months, you'll gain experience that would take 5\-7 years in a single\-company role. You'll serve as Controller for 2\-5 Series B\-C companies simultaneously—each with $20M\-$200M\+ in revenue, complex operations, and boards that demand excellence. You'll have the stability, resources and infrastructure of a 17 year old, 250\-person firm and you'll receive training in AI\-enabled financial intelligence that doesn't exist anywhere else.  


  

This is foundational work—and it's the future.  


  

Nearly 17 years ago, we set out to find a better way to help the country's leading startups navigate the financial hazards that follow their first institutional funding.  


  

Today, Propeller's 250\+ full\-time professionals across three continents serve as the embedded finance and accounting partner to some of the most iconic emerging companies in Consumer, Technology, Blockchain, and Business Services.  


  

**Our embedded teams integrate seamlessly into client operations in multi\-year partnerships.** You'll attend weekly leadership meetings, participate in board prep, collaborate on strategic decisions, and have direct access to client CEOs and CFOs. This embedded positioning creates trust, access and influence that traditional providers never achieve.  


  

With our Financial Operating Platform—combining human judgment, precise accounting, data infrastructure, and AI\-enabled insight—**we transform finance from a back\-office function into the central nervous system of growth.**  

* Experience 2\-5 business models, GTM strategies, and leadership styles simultaneously
* Navigate wins and lessons\-learned across multiple companies and multiple stages
* Index clients against Propeller’s stage\-specific benchmarks to develop context for your instincts
* Regular interaction with Series B and C CFOs, CEOs, and stakeholders
* Present financials and strategic recommendations to sophisticated audiences
* Build relationships that become your professional network for life
* Hands\-on experience with Propeller's Intelligence Engine (PIE) and Data Lake (PDL)
* Learn to leverage systems and automation that transforms patterns into predictions
* Prepare for the future of finance while others react to it
* 17\-year\-old firm with strong balance sheet, 250 people and competitive compensation
* None of the startup risk, all of the upside learning
* Infrastructure and support that solo controllers rarely have
* Propeller alumni have gone on to earn CFO and controller roles at multiple unicorns and nine\-figure companies—**this role is a launchpad, not a landing pad**


  

Let's be direct about what it takes to succeed here:  


  

You'll juggle 2\-5 clients with different fiscal calendars, reporting requirements, board schedules, and growth stages. Without systematic thinking and disciplined execution, you'll drown. If you prefer improvisation over process, this isn't your role.  


  

You'll receive direct feedback frequently from senior controllers, CFO partners, and clients. Your ability to implement it quickly determines your success. If you need to be right more than you need to get better, this isn't your role.  


  

No lone wolves. You're building systems that outlive any individual engagement. Your insights become institutional knowledge. Your workflows help the next controller scale faster. If you hoard knowledge or prefer solo work, this isn't your role.  


  

Month\-end close means 2\-5 companies close simultaneously. Series B CFOs and boards expect precision, timeliness, and strategic perspective. If you prefer predictable 9\-5 rhythms, this isn't your role.  


  

Every client teaches something new. Technology platforms evolve. AI tools advance almost daily. Industry dynamics shift. If you prefer mastery through repetition over growth through challenge, this isn't your role.  


  

The Controller at Propeller builds systems that turn financial data into strategic foresight. You'll lead engagement teams to deliver month\-end closes with excellence while transforming traditional controller work—historically reactive and backward\-looking—into a proactive, AI\-enabled function that surfaces insights before problems arise.### **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Oversee engagement teams across U.S. and international personnel, delegating work to maximize efficiency
* Mentor and develop team members, actively supporting professional growth
* Manage utilization and client load to ensure team members are challenged, supported, and operating at optimal capacity
* Codify and share best practices, contributing to Propeller's institutional knowledge and platform intelligence
* Optimize margins and business unit efficiency, recognizing that Propeller's economics shift from hours billed to value delivered
* Proactively engage in Early Warning processes to surface issues before they escalate
* Support client pipeline development in collaboration with Business Development, CFO team, and Customer Experience
* Identify upsell and lifecycle extension opportunities by understanding client needs and demonstrating incremental value
* Partner with Customer Success to ensure deliverables meet Propeller's standards and drive client satisfaction
* Conduct periodic client file reviews to identify learning opportunities, develop best practices, and feed insights back into the platform
